TINA

(CURRENTLY STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS)

We aim to create a conversational agent (TINA) designed to offer comfort to users suffering from depression by providing on-demand comforting social interaction as well as suggesting/providing professional resources that users can turn to.

TINA is unique in that she utilizes reinforcement learning to reward unique and warm responses as well as being externally rewarded through interaction with user to constantly learn and adapt to user's needs. The aim is for users to chat with her on a daily basis and, over time, she can evolve and form a unique relationship with each user.
