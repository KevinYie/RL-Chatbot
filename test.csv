"  Hello, thanks for reading and I apologize for the length.¬†About a month and a half ago, something happened in my relationship (my fault) that kind of triggered (at first) an enormous amount of guilt.. which then subsided a little bit. I was good for a few days and then bam... ""do I love him?"" a thought so truly devastating and painful that I was crying all day. A man, so loyal...loving...caring...truly the love of my life. We have a relationship like you've never seen before. It's so unique and that's what makes it so special. But when these thoughts started... I truly feel like I've lost myself. These thoughts give me multiple breakdowns a week.. cause me to feel extremely overwhelmed everyday. I feel tired, exhausted.. I don't fantasize about my future anymore because the want to ""live"" is kind of gone. (Not a suicide threat). ¬†Before all of this... my boyfriend made me so damn happy. Everyday, my love truly grew stronger for him. We talked about our future, and what we want. We have all of it in common. ¬†I can still be sexual with him some days. But when I overthink and get these thoughts...I cannot. It's truly killing me because I don't want to end things with him... all I want to do is get back to being happy with him. I keep getting these intrusive thoughts like ""do I love him"" ""what if I will feel like this forever and the only way to get better is if we leave each other"". I cannot be without him.. everything we've talked about.. all the memories we made. He truly loved me to the core and I do too.. but these thoughts are killing me. When we're apart, like rn.. we sleep on the phone together every night and it's something I can't not do. I cry to him over the phone, explaining to him how much this is hurting me. He tries to understand to the best of his ability and he's as supportive as he can be. Could I be depressed and anxious? The first 2 weeks of this issue.. I was lying in bed all day all night.. I was sweating with a cold feeling and every noise I heart scared me and made my heart race. I did not eat, I did not sleep right. Just so many issues that have again, slowed down a bit. What should I do? üòû. The only time these feelings kinda go away is when I do things together with my boyfriend. When I'm alone and SOMETIMES with him, the thoughts hit me and I just want to cry. I don't feel free.. I feel trapped in a pool of my own thoughts trying to eat me alive. Please help meüòû ",  Hi ChantalAnxiety can cause us to doubt everything I'm sure you do love him. I doubt everything with Anxiety. It sounds like you're depressed also. A therapist can help you. Don't think you don't love him its the depression and anxiety. A therapist will properly diagnose you and give you treatment. Good LucküëçWhat I got from what you mention is that you feel better when distracted by doing things like hobbies ect.¬†You were panicking the first two weeks with what you're describing.

Please help meüòû ","  Hi Chantal,I‚Äôm writing to ask if you‚Äôve found any relief, as I am going through exactly the same thing. I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for a little over a year now. He‚Äôs been absolutely wonderful as well. Loyal, kind, loving, nurturing, fun, funny, etc. I know I want to marry this man. Although I‚Äôm only 22, I messed around enough and dated enough trash to know that someone like my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt come around often. I‚Äôve found a true gem. He‚Äôs become a part of my future. However, I was unfaithful to him in the beginning of our relationship. I didn‚Äôt confess until last year in October. He was distraught, which also affected me because I was, and still am, tremendously ashamed of what I did. How could I hurt him like that?? I sobbed for a week and I slowly began to feel happy again‚Äîor so it seemed. About a week later after finally feeling okay again I began to have awful intrusive thoughts. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt really love him.‚Äù Since that day the thoughts have spiraled so much that I am now convinced I don‚Äôt truly love my boyfriend & I will get tired of him. But I‚Äôm still here (I live with him) because I know deep down I must love him, before all this nonsense started. My therapist told me I‚Äôm going through a wave of depression, though I also have terrible anxiety‚Äîmy intrusive unwanted thoughts. I‚Äôm growing increasingly hopeless because I‚Äôve no sex drive & keep thinking it must be because ¬†I don‚Äôt love my bf. It‚Äôs tryly exhausting. I hope you are feeling better. If not, I truly hope you can find the help you need because it sounds a lot like what I am currently going through.

I‚Äôm going through the same thing & it didn‚Äôt start until my depression & anxiety were onset by my birth control pills. I got off as soon as I realized they were effecting my ability to feel.

I can‚Äôt tell if what i‚Äôm feeling is real or in my mind.

"  Yesterday I woke up to my boyfriend saying ""we need to talk."" We agreed that he would come to my place after work to talk. my boyfriend came to my house with a very puffy and swollen eyes that night obviously he cried a lot. He told me that for a while now he feels as if he has suddenly fallen out of love of me and he has no idea why. Even before dating my boyfriend he told me the reason why his past relationship ended was because of this as well, whenever he gets into a relationship while everything is going well he would just slowly fall out of love without reason, he never really talked to anyone about this before but he honestly thinks there is something wrong with him. anyway, my boyfriend told me he feels like he has fallen out of me and that he doesn't know why and he feels like he just wants to be alone. he said he still likes me and still cares for me it's just he feels like there's just no romantic feelings anymore and he said he is so confused and he is so upset cause everything was going well and non of us has done anything wrong. he keeps telling me for a while now that he thinks there is something wrong with him and thats also why he thinks why he has fallen out of love and just wanted to be alone. I did not agree to break up with him and told him that base on his reasons I think he needs to see a therapist and that we can work things out, i told him I am not agreeing to the break up because i think he needs someone to support him and that i believe we can still work things out especially if he seeks professional help. when I first suggested for him to seek professional help he hesitated and said his pride wont let him but after talking for a while we agreed to stay together but set up boundaries for now since he feels the need to be alone and away from me for awhile and wanted some space, and he also finally agreed that he thinks he needs to see a psychologist and is actually looking for one right now. Has anybody experienced their loved one falling out of love or feel like they dont love you anymore because of depression or does it feel like he really fell out of love with me? Ive been really sad lately, i cant help but cry all the time, we still talk like usual but i just cant help to be sad thinking someone i love suddenly feel like they dont love me anymore. but on the other hand im happy that he is willing to seek help and try to work things out. i just feel like if this has happened before and it history kept repeating itself and he hasnt done anything about it its because he has never had someone there supporting him and its because he had never tried seeking help relating to this issue. ","  hi envyme, aw bless you! you care about him massively - that's why you're getting so upset over all of this. look after yourself, you can't help him unless you look after you, do something nice for you and you may feel a bit better. as for him once he seeks support his mood may pick up, with some luck, that may help you and it might put your relationship back on track. i really wish you both luck, i hope the outcome is what you need. i know sort of how you feel,my husband has continually looked after me since we were married as i have health problems and he's never walked out on me. my health is finally slowly on the mend so not being dependent on him feels great.

Please do not remain in a household with an abusive drinker.  And please don't say ""oh he doesnt do it that often"".  These men ALWAYS escalate their abusive behavior.

","  I've not had the kind of experience you're having being ignored when you most need attention and the kinds of feelings you have as a result. But I want to say that perhaps expecting anything different is putting too much expectation on the relationship. Do you want to stay in it and see what happens or do you want to call it a mistake and take steps to dissolve the union? If you feel that you are not stable enough to be in a relationship, then you could take the latter course. If you feel that the situation is over 50% okay and acceptable then you could wait it out and stay where you are without making changes.

"  Hi First time posting here. I went onto Mirtazapine at the start of March. I'd been trying to avoid antidepressants but then had to conceed that maybe they were worth a try as I wasn't getting anywhere. I was mainly prescribed it for depression, but I also have bad anxiety and OCD so the thinking was that it'd help that also. I started off on 15mg. At first I felt it really helped; I slept better, and though I felt a bit spaced out I felt quite nice and calm and serene compared to normal. Unfortunately about three weeks in I felt like it just stopped working, though it was hard to tell if I'd have felt worse if I hadn't been on it. I spoke with my GP who suggested upping the dose to 30mg which I did. I've been on 30mg for two weeks now and haven't really felt a positive change in my mood though I know it can take time. What I have noticed, unfortunately, is that my asthma seems to be markedly worse since taking the higher dose. I'm taking more of my preventer inhaler than I've been prescribed (though I was prescribed a child's dose with it made clear I could up it quite safely) and using my reliever a lot. I had a virtual GP appointment a couple of days ago and it was suggested that I should drop back to 15mg to see if it helped my tight chest. I asked if it was safe to drop straight to 15mg, being mindful of the fact that one has to be careful reducing the dose of anti depressants, and was told that it would be okay. I (perhaps rather stupidly) thought that as I'd only been on the higher dose for two weeks that it'd be okay to drop down to 15mg straight away. Today I was wondering why I felt so awful (horrible headache, nausea, feeling tearful and unable to cope with anything) until I realised I'd only taken 15mg of Mirtazapine last night! I'm hoping it's that and I'm not coming down with something. So I just thought I'd post here to see if anyone had had a similar experience lowering their Mirtazapine dose and also to see if anyone else had experienced breathing issues whilst on Mirtazapine. I feel at the moment like I'm almost having to choose between feeling depressed and not being able to breathe properly if indeed it is the Mirtazapine causing the issue. ","  hi Chloe, i have responded to you because i don't believe in leaving people stuck. what i have read is worrying, i confess i am no expert but unless the medication specifically says breathing difficulties i would be inclined to ring your doctor. asthma is no joke and if yours has been caused by your medication then i don't think the medication is for you. i have never taken antidepressants but know sometimes medication doesn't help. apart from medication has anyone offered you any other support, maybe a talking therapy? we have a company here called life links who deal with mental health issues - do you have anyone like that where you are? ask to see them! good luck, it's tough, i am myself having intense counselling for assault, which is terrifying, but won't take antidepressants as they never helped me at all.

","  Hi Sam thank you for your message. Unfortunately I have tried counselling etc, tried to avoid anti depressants for a couple of years but in the end had to conceed that I should probably try them. I stuck it out and stayed on 15mg, the effects seemed to reduce relatively quickly I think because I'd only been on 30mg for a relatively short time, and I feel like it's a bit too early to say but I think my breathing has been better since being on a lower dose. I'm going to try to have a 'phone GP appointment next week for some advice and I also did wonder if I needed to report the side effect of it affecting my asthma. I'm sorry you are going through a difficult time with such a horrible thing, best wishes.

Anytime you are taking a medication and experience side effects you should consult your Dr.....some side effects can go away once you have been taking it for awhile, some mean that particular drug may not be right for you...So see what your Dr says: If you can keep track of your HR bring your record with you when you go!!Good Luck with your treatment...Best Wishesüíí‚ôæüíûüêæüåàüé∂üçÄ‚òÆ        ",None

I'm constantly analyzing myself and now I'm just in huge doubts. & how can I figure out when I'm so anxious?

","  Ah, I saw the app ask a pretty high prince (at least for me). I'm unemployed because of my mental health problems. I still live at my parents house as well. I feel like a adult baby, it's  depressing. I avoid almost every social contact besides them. Even phone calls give me anxiety. I just feel so uncomfortable in this world. I've been on antidepressants as well, but they didn't work for me either. I fear everything that effects my mind. Even drinking a cup of tea is something I don't do anymore. The most frustrating part is that I often don't even know where I'm exactly afraid of. I can't even imagine how it feels to have fun anymore. So seeing others having fun about things (I used to like) isn't really there. I can be pretty irritated by the smallest things, which isn't something I want to choose to do. It's goes automatically pretty much. That line you wrote down sounds familiar to me and it is pretty annoying indeed. I often feel like people don't understand and take me serious. But on the other hand, I can understand it, because you will only know how difficult it is when you've gone through the same. You can't see anything on the outside about me. I just look healthy, but on the inside I feel like a dying tree. About the future, well, every time I think about the future it's dramatically. I haven't had a single relationship because I've always struggled. In the past I always had hope my time will come eventually, but now, nope, it will give me even horrible thoughts thinking about it. I just feel like I don't fit with others anymore. I've had a pretty social life in the past, but that's just changed drastically.

","  Hey Dave, So great you're doing well. I am recently diagnosed with panic disorder, depression and a touch of ocd. Also have agoraphobia perhaps, but it's coming from my panic disorder. Everything you've said sounds familiar to me. Almost everything connects to the fact of me fearing to lose control or/and my mind. It's a dreadful experience and I still really ain't convinced that I can fully get out of my situation although some people say I can. It's just hard to see light if you're in the middle of your own problems. You can probably relate to that. The things which is hard for me and I don't read that often is that my negative feelings are basically constantly and they are in every corner. Watching a thriller movie or drinking a cup of tea is something I even avoid because of the fear of losing my mind. I often don't really know why. I've lost my confidence in who I am and I'm often afraid I'm a bad person or something. Scary thoughts are going through my mind and I feel disconnected. Last time I was outside my house (2 weeks ago) everything felt so overwhelming. I'm just so stuck. It's hard to make another move in my recovery, because I'm fighting this for so long and the hard work I put in exposure was for nothing. Anyway, lots of what I wrote down is personal, but do you have tips for gaining your confidence back? Perhaps you can't relate, but I feel like I 'lost' myself, because I haven't been feeling good for a long time and all what's going on all day long is my anxiety. This fear of losing my mind is really ruling my life. Or do I already have lost my mind? I don't know, I just can't seem to relax. I wish I was less self centered and it's also is giving me stress. I really hate the fact that all I think about is myself.

","  Hi Contakt2,...Sorry to hear of your 'current state and  troubles'...Let me see if I can be of some help...I think you may of initially started suffering with depression..and all the horrible symptoms that can come with it...a lack of emotions, emptiness (even towards loved ones)...physical exaustion..aches pains..bewilderment..feelings of unreality ..as if your seeing life through a window..but are disconnected from it..a loss of self...eventually you start to feel overwhelmed being in this state of existence...you get more and more self analytical  anxious...constatly trying to figure out what is wrong with you..you are constantly over analyzing every..single thought, feeling and sensation...you are basically in a constant battle mode...sensitized....(firing on all cylinders).Because of this you are constantly trying to figure out why this is happening..your thoughts are focused..obsessively..constantly trying to figure it all out..you become self absorbed and pre occupied with it all...the feelings of emptiness and loss, 'of yourself'  become overwhelming..frightening, bewildering..etc.This makes you more anxious...You eventually start to feel and gradually accept ""well, to believe""... that you cannot win this battle..that it is hopeless...you doubt your own self worth...you feel you are a failure..to yourself..and to your loved ones...this is where the guilt comes in...which then brings more despair and sadness...more depression...Eventually you have zero confidence or self worth and then start to withdraw from life...you become a spectator or an observer...your also trying to understand all this and to figure out where the old you went to...and how you got to where you are..the sense of loss..of yourself becomes unbearable...and you begin to see the effect it has on your loved ones... and feel more guilt...At times all this becomes so overwhelming that you occasionally overload...you will have a""Panic Attack""...which can be one of the most frightening and debilitating experiences you could ever experience..it would seem to just come out of the blue..for no apparent reason...you constantly look for a reason why this is happening..searching..recalling when, where it happened..you start to relate various times 'and places'...as triggers..the shops, motorways, events, out walking, outside your home, your living room..your bedroom...it all becomes overwhelming....so you retreat from it all..avoid it all...it becomes easier to do this than to face it..for the fear it brings...the fear of a 'panic attack'.Basically you have now developed ""Agoraphobia""...(A fear of Fear).You start to avoid..more and more..all the places and situations that you relate to bringing on these horrendous, horrible panic attacks..but the constant anxiety never leaves you..the fear grinds away at you...you are in an anxiety state..or a state of constant vigilance and  alertness..on a permanent lookout for the next panic attack..to try to avoid it....(the cycle repeats). A FEAR OF FEAR.Does this ring any bells...?..Its now 5.50 am...I'll have a break and a coffee... please give any feedback you can if you relate to any of this..and I will give you advice and perspective and also some of my coping strategies and alternative reasoning on it all that helped me get to where I am today....in a good place.Take care..

","  It's almost exactly right. I do think I suffer from depression which is caused by my anxiety and perhaps just my personal crisis. Who am I and what I want in life etc. All the depressive symptoms are also increasing my anxiety. The feeling of being emotionally numb is something I feel all the time. I have the inability to cry and have real joy for example. I feel like those emotions are very far away and locked up, but I do feel like it's in me.. I feel like a sponge full of emotions, but I don't know what to with them. My grandma is diagnosed with cancer last week and I just don't know how to feel about it. It's like I feel nothing, only anxiety and stress. I'm ashamed by it. I start to wonder if there is something wrong with me. Am I a bad person? I start to avoid all things which may trigger this feeling. From drinking a cup of tea (caffeine) to watching a movie. I often also feel like I have to avoid contact with my own family. I'm ashamed of who I've become. I feel overwhelmed very quickly. My hobby music is heavily affected by this as well. I always loved to make electronic music, but I can't concentrate on all the busy sounds anymore. I feel guilt.. A bit. But also not. I've become very egocentric because of my current situation. I hate it. I don't want to feel this way. I hate myself for being that way. It's not that I not try to not be busy how others feels, but more like the only thing that matters is myself. What you said about being analytical is totally true for me. My mind is constantly scanning for problems. There is no room to breath. It's exhausting. I have to be constantly alert. I often wonder what is possible. Is there even a way to get better? I've tried lots of exposures, but eventually I did it all for nothing, because it only became worse. I often have this frozen sensation, or well, basically almost all the time. Like everything is going past me. Like I'm not really here. My panic attacks most of the time really come out of the blue. I feel them coming up weeks before the actual events. I do have waves where my anxiety increases. I feel more rushed and stress. This do can come out of nowhere without really a particular reason. The worst thing where I am afraid of is losing control and my mind. Also in a panic situation this most of the time for me to feel that way. I'm afraid of having psychoses and not being myself. Although I never had a psychosis. One of the reasons I became in this situation is caused by weed. At that time I did feel like I wasn't in control. Maybe it has something to do with it. I have developed fear of fear. I am afraid of feeling this way. Especially in situation where I can't get out. But again, I do feel constantly not well. Back to what I said in the beginning. About wondering who I actually am. You do have to keep in mind I'm 20 years old. This all started when I was 17 years old. Before that time my life was difficult as well and I experienced social anxiety a lot of times as well. I often feel like I have to hide myself from the world because I don't know who I am. I often have scary thoughts running through my mind. I don't want them to come true one day. Maybe not all of what I wrote sounds familiar to you, but I do think I relate to a lot. Thank you btw for helping someone out. I hope to do the same one day if I feel somewhat better.

","  hi Contakt2 (C) from now on...sorry about the delay in replying..had me hands full m8. i didn't realize you were so young. You need to draw a line under this and start believing in yourself again. Depression and anxiety  can steal everything from you if you let it.Depression I would say is the feeling of loss of ones self. An emptiness, sadness, loneliness and despair.I would say that Anxiety is a feeling of constant agitation, worry, of being tense, hyper vigilant to the next fear provoking event or situation (in order to avoid it).You are also constantly aware of all the emotions, thoughts and sensations when you are anxious..obsessively studying all these. Waiting  for the next sign of threat or danger. All this analyzing is releasing a bit more Adrenalin  and other hormones  to keep you alert, aware and prepared to get you ready to fight or to escape from it. Whether it is real or perceived. During this state of readiness you are aware of your physical symptoms, such as you may feel shaky, sick in your stomach , your legs and arms may feel weak, your heart may be pounding, you may sweat more and possibly other sensations and feelings. You may be convinced that you may die, lose control or even worse embarrass yourself. This is 'all' actually just the normal effect of our 'good and vital friend' (Adrenalin). This is the effect it has on the body. As simple as that. The problem is..that people who are anxious start to fear the Adrenalin response. They are looking for outer triggers, events , situations or places that make them feel this way (constantly, obsessively). This can be exhausting. when they cannot find any reason outwardly they start to look within...and become even more focused on the way they are feeling..when they cannot find a reason they start to think that they are going insane and then start to reason about what this means.  What if i have this? what if it is that?? etc... It is the 'WHAT IFS' with Anxiety that gives it power. They may be studying the internet and other sources looking for an explanation. When they feel they cannot find it...a feeling of hopelessness  might set in and they may feel that they are on a downward spiral and start to feel more and more depressed. Then they might start to believe that this is how things are from now on...a feeling of defeat, loss, acceptance and despair may start to engulf them. Which may reinforce to them that they are ill and cannot do anything about it. WELL THIS IS WRONG!Depression is the mind and body's way of dealing with emotional trauma of one sort or another. A defense  mechanism to help us to deal with and recover. It takes away the pain of loss, regret or disappointment that we may feel. it puts us in a state of limbo, we may feel unreal, isolated, and empty. We are being removed from ourselves in order deal with it all. A defense mechanism. Over time we may feel we cannot find our way back to ourselves and we can see this loss of ""WHO I WAS"" as devastating and further despair over this.Can you relate C?I will be back on asap with further insight and info from my own experiences that may help to deal with and overcome it all.Take care.

","  Hey Dave, Don't worry, take your time. I'm already glad you want to help me out a bit. Yes, that believing in myself is pretty much gone. I'm even started to fear myself, because of my unpleasant feelings and thoughts. I'm afraid of exposing myself to the world and my fears, because I might be a bad person or something. Everything I do and say I analyze over and over again. It makes me insecure. Things that might trigger a lose of control or mind are things I avoid. Even something like drinking a cup of tea  because the caffeine does affect my feelings and mind. I know it's placebo, because I never had any problems with such things whatsoever. But also just when I'm not busy with my fears I feel generally stressed out. It's the most exhausting thing ever. I've noticed I'm very egocentric. This makes me feel very bad about myself. When I hear bad news I don't know how to react. I feel frozen and emptiness. The only thing I feel is anxiety. My derealization does significantly boost all my problems. I'm afraid of losing control and my mind, but often I don't even know what would happen, but the feeling stays. This is very frustrating. I'm afraid of expressing my feelings. I agree with your description about depression and anxiety. I do feel anxiety as well just in the moment itself without a particular event going on or coming up. The rest of what you said is something I pretty much all relate to.

Your experience with medications seems frustrating to say the least. I hear you saying you're scared and I'm assuming you mean you're scared of what any medication adjustments will do to you and also you're scared about possibly losing your job. It sounds, though, like the Citalopram has been successful except for the 'dips' in your mood.  Once you've been given the highest dose available of that medication (40 mg.?) perhaps you could add some anxiety medication and see how the combination works for you. Please do not take any medication you're scared of like the Venlaxafine. I take Citalopram plus Buspirone for anxiety and it works very well for me.        ",None

Can I ask if you ever suffered from anxiety or depression before? If not, then if it were me I would be changing my GP (anti depressants are not prescribed for sleeping problems). I have been on medication for 22 years for mental health and changing medication can be really rough. I am concerned though that your symptoms may be due to side effects from the medication, especially if you have no prior mental health problems. Have you been offered any CBT by your psychiatrist? For some people medication is not the answer sometimes it makes the situation worse and there are other psychiatric therapies available. The medical profession in this country are handing out anti depressants like candy, it is very disturbing. Practise breathing exercises or guided meditation, you will find both on utube. Please remember you are not alone. I am here if  you want to chat. Best WishesLouisa ÔòÄ        ",None

","  Hi Chase, I posted on this a year ago going through the same thing, in September I had to get my doctor to put me on Sertraline because I was tiring myself out so much with this issue, constantly inside my head trying to work out what was wrong with me/my relationship. And there was absolutely nothing wrong with it!You‚Äôve probably read other replies saying ‚ÄúWe broke up in the end‚Äù, but after being on the anti depressant for 6/7 month, I came off it myself and everything was back to normal for me. I think what generally happened to me was that I went into a depression where I didn‚Äôt feel much at all (you become accustomed to it after a while, so you feel as though you‚Äôll be like this forever), and therefore didn‚Äôt feel anything for my boyfriend.In November last year he broke up with me (it was the worst time for me, which basically concluded in my head that I hadn‚Äôt wanted to break up with him all along and I had realised it too late), because he noticed the change and he couldn‚Äôt bare to see it in me. We were broken up for about 3 weeks and now we‚Äôre back together heading to our 4th year, going travelling next month and buying a house together later this year.¬†You have 2 options in this situation:1. STOP GETTING STUCK INSIDE YOUR HEAD. If you start thinking that you don‚Äôt love your partner, don‚Äôt pay any attention to the thought, just let it run through your mind like any other thought, otherwise you‚Äôll get stuck in a horrible pattern of overthinking the same situation. This will help you, I promise. This is what anti-depressants do, they calm your mind and take away your overthinking so maybe you could try them for a few months, just DON‚ÄôT stay on them forever.2. You could take a break from your partner. Having serious space will make you realise if you miss them or not, in your situation, if you‚Äôre suffering the same as we were, then I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll realise you don‚Äôt want to lose your partner & that you‚Äôre just emotionally numb at the moment.Try not to feel too guilty about your thoughts either, it‚Äôs not your fault! Hope you take my advice and things get better for you!         ",I don t want to leave him  and I don t ever think about what it would be like to be with anyone else.

What do you reccomend the most and what mindset should i have? Should i try meet her and see if i feel guilty or not or try see her a bit less?

"  HelloI have been happily married for a long time. We've had our ups and downs, like any normal marriage, but there's always been a lot of love.We've just come through a horrifically stressful 18 months, mainly due to financial worries. I have felt permanently stressed, worried, very vulnerable and often humiliated (unable to pay for school trips, turning down social invitations etc). My self esteem has taken a battering and some days have been so hard. But, I've soldiered on, kept my chin up and still took a lot of comfort in the fact that, despite everything, we still had each other and we still had a lot of love.But, these last 6 weeks something has changed. I'm experiencing feelings of anxiety and panic. I can only feel negative about life. All my optimism has gone, and I feel like I have nothing left to fight with anymore.But, the very worst thing is that I feel like I don't have any love left for my husband anymore. It's all gone. When I look at him, I just feel tense and anxious. Just him being around makes me feel worse, and I have to force myself to be affectionate, and I have to pretend to be my normal myself. I genuinely feel that if I won the Lottery tomorrow I would walk away from him, and never look back. There's been a few rare flashes of the old loving feelings these last few weeks, but that's all.I feel calmer, more centered when I'm alone, or with our children. The moment my husband walks in from work I tense up, I feel more anxious and I try to avoid him in the house. When only 2-3 months ago, cuddling up on the sofa with him was the best part of my day. I don't understand what is happening to me? Have I stopped loving him, because I'm depressed/suffering with anxiety? Or, am I suffering with depression/anxiety because I have stopped loving him?There's no denying that deep down I probably hold him responsibile for our current financial difficulties. He's a very clever man, but he's made a few reckless decisions, and he admits that often he doesn't 'work smart' but busies himself with stuff that interests him, rather than work that would be more financially productive. Added to this, he's admitted he feels very down and withdrawn, and certainly he's not the optimistic, dynamic man I knew and loved only a few months ago. But, he's still affectionate and caring towards me.I would really appreciate it if anyone could respond and reassure me that something similar has happened to them, and that's it's down to anxiety/depression. Otherwise I can't believe that 20 years of marriage has come to an end.Thank you. ","  Your marriage is not over, you are more likely to be focussing on your husband as a tangible reason for all your problems.

"  HelloI have been happily married for a long time. We've had our ups and downs, like any normal marriage, but there's always been a lot of love.We've just come through a horrifically stressful 18 months, mainly due to financial worries. I have felt permanently stressed, worried, very vulnerable and often humiliated (unable to pay for school trips, turning down social invitations etc). My self esteem has taken a battering and some days have been so hard. But, I've soldiered on, kept my chin up and still took a lot of comfort in the fact that, despite everything, we still had each other and we still had a lot of love.But, these last 6 weeks something has changed. I'm experiencing feelings of anxiety and panic. I can only feel negative about life. All my optimism has gone, and I feel like I have nothing left to fight with anymore.But, the very worst thing is that I feel like I don't have any love left for my husband anymore. It's all gone. When I look at him, I just feel tense and anxious. Just him being around makes me feel worse, and I have to force myself to be affectionate, and I have to pretend to be my normal myself. I genuinely feel that if I won the Lottery tomorrow I would walk away from him, and never look back. There's been a few rare flashes of the old loving feelings these last few weeks, but that's all.I feel calmer, more centered when I'm alone, or with our children. The moment my husband walks in from work I tense up, I feel more anxious and I try to avoid him in the house. When only 2-3 months ago, cuddling up on the sofa with him was the best part of my day. I don't understand what is happening to me? Have I stopped loving him, because I'm depressed/suffering with anxiety? Or, am I suffering with depression/anxiety because I have stopped loving him?There's no denying that deep down I probably hold him responsibile for our current financial difficulties. He's a very clever man, but he's made a few reckless decisions, and he admits that often he doesn't 'work smart' but busies himself with stuff that interests him, rather than work that would be more financially productive. Added to this, he's admitted he feels very down and withdrawn, and certainly he's not the optimistic, dynamic man I knew and loved only a few months ago. But, he's still affectionate and caring towards me.I would really appreciate it if anyone could respond and reassure me that something similar has happened to them, and that's it's down to anxiety/depression. Otherwise I can't believe that 20 years of marriage has come to an end.Thank you. ","  Well I feel very similar to you , as my boyfriends in Iraq I feel as though we've split up , we've only seen each other for a months worth of our relationship , what I've come to realise is that if I didn't love him I wouldn't be stressing out over it all I wouldn't care, what I think you should do is stick it out , find someone professional to talk to that may be able to help and wait until next time you see him then talk to him about your feelings , will take a massive weight off your shoulders , it's tough but you can get through it as it's not worth letting go of the person you want because of your own head , don't let your anxiety get the better of your relationship , seek for help and have a positive mind set (or try cause I know how difficult that can be) and eventually you should start to feel better , I have another 5 months to wait until my boyfriend is back from Iraq so I will be doing exactly what I've said I think you should do , just keep strong ,hope this helps         ",But  I ve soldiered on  kept my chin up and still took a lot of comfort in the fact that  despite everything  we still had each other and we still had a lot of love.But  these last   weeks something has changed.

It wasnt easy at all, I was living with him for 3 month and we both love our company. Everything is going good everytime we are together and we I back to my country and start LDR again it going not well. People say when you have LDR, trust is the key in relationship. I was trust him before untill I saw that he tried to getting back together with his ex 2 years ago. That was a nightmare for me and since I knew that I got anxiety and depression. I've been talk to my bf about that, he didnt explain what exactly happened between them but he did promise to me not gonna happen again and not in love with that girl. He promise to me that she not gonna in our life and he is not gonna goin accross. But I cant trust him easly. After thats happened I felt that our love is unequal, I am feeling that i give him too much love and attention and it wasnt enough untill he got attractive with other girl. I dont know what to do, I dont wanna thinking about it but my mind is so f****d up atm. The worst is my bf having depression about financial which he say he needs his own time        ",But  I ve soldiered on  kept my chin up and still took a lot of comfort in the fact that  despite everything  we still had each other and we still had a lot of love.But  these last   weeks something has changed.

The moment my husband walks in from work I tense up, I feel more anxious and I try to avoid him in the house. When only 2-3 months ago, cuddling up on the sofa with him was the best part of my day.

"  HelloI have been happily married for a long time. We've had our ups and downs, like any normal marriage, but there's always been a lot of love.We've just come through a horrifically stressful 18 months, mainly due to financial worries. I have felt permanently stressed, worried, very vulnerable and often humiliated (unable to pay for school trips, turning down social invitations etc). My self esteem has taken a battering and some days have been so hard. But, I've soldiered on, kept my chin up and still took a lot of comfort in the fact that, despite everything, we still had each other and we still had a lot of love.But, these last 6 weeks something has changed. I'm experiencing feelings of anxiety and panic. I can only feel negative about life. All my optimism has gone, and I feel like I have nothing left to fight with anymore.But, the very worst thing is that I feel like I don't have any love left for my husband anymore. It's all gone.

",  I think it's best to withhold judgment when on a new medication.  At such a time what you're feeling could be caused by simply switching medications.  So if I were you I would wait until you've gotten more stable with the new med before drawing any conclusions about your break up.  You will probably be going through some emotional changes due to the transition of meds and therefore your opinions and feelings at present might be unreliable until you stabilize.  You could benefit I'm sure from discussing this situation with the prescribing doctor and ask his/her opinion about what's going on in your life.        ,None

If you can make your day into a routine each day it helps with the eating disorder.  Try to fill your daily schedule with things you like to do rather than just obligations like chores.  My fun starts at around 5 or 6 when I crash for the night and watch netflix. If there's somewhere you can sit outside alone and breathe the fresh air it's very good for you just so you dont have contact with other people. Remember that feeling when you used to get to stay home from school?  Did you enjoy that feeling?  If so try to recreate that. It's never selfish to ask for help or do anything else to take care of ourselves.  In fact it's the moral thing to do.  Do your best to make yourself happy.  For me I love to do emails with my canadian penpal and I love to sketch and do sodoku and read.        ,None
"  Hi all, For a bit of background, I have suffered with anxiety in my life and this spiralled out of control for about a year in 2017, where I was forever anxious and depressed. I recovered during 2018 and ended the year feeling as happy as I have ever been. Life was going well on the whole. However, the past two months of this year has been tough. What triggered it off was convincing myself to feel comfortable in resuming my dating life at the end of last year. Just before the Christmas break I got speaking to someone I was interested in and she asked me out for coffee when we were both back in the same place in January. However, on the day it didn't go as I'd hoped and she (politely) said that we weren't compatible afterwards. This should be 'fair enough' as these things happen, not everyone can be compatible. However, I took this hard because I have realised I am still overly critical of myself and struggle with people's perception of me. I did the wrong thing and let it affect my own self-worth and started questioning my own values which I thought I had. I admit that I maybe got a little bit too excited, since I thought that what she put as who she was looking for seemed to fit how I view myself. As it didn't it has left me attacking myself for not being who I thought I was and worrying about how people view me, thinking they must think badly of me, be it of my character, values, intelligence or whatever. What has stunted me further is regret over letting nerves get to me. I admit that I got nervous when we went for coffee and I feel this affected me, so that I wasn't creating a positive enough impression of myself. I don't mean that I created the impression that I was horrible, but not of someone who is demonstrating their worth. Like someone who doesn't talk enough about their suitability in a job interview. So, I get ruminations of ""why on Earth didn't I speak about that, that's something I should have talked about given what you know about her"" or ""who on Earth did I speak about that? That was a dull subject and didn't focus on the aspects where you think you're compatible."" It's ridiculous, futile and may not have even mattered. I am not naive enough to think that if I spoke about everything how I wanted to with a confident mindset it would have definitely led to anything more. However, as I feel like could have been less nervous and could have spoke about better things in a more nuanced way than I did, which has led to me dwelling on what might have been if I had been more at ease and gave an impression of myself which brought out my best traits. I have felt similar during interviews when I have felt I didn't bring out my best skills. I have spoken to a friend and they have stated that I didn't say anything wrong, so I shouldn't beat myself up about it, but the dwelling persists. I know it's ridiculous, the idea that this person was the only one who'd suit me is silly, but I keep berating myself over this. I then berate myself for still dwelling on it, saying I am like these clingy, obsessive guys who can't let go, even though deep down I do want to move on. It's just my anxieties and negative views of myself have used to this to berate myself over it. I know that I wouldn't do anything creepy or obsessive; I have seen her around since and have done nothing untoward and wouldn't do. I know that this would not be right. However, I cannot stop the wishing that things were different, wishing that I'd given my 'best,' so that I could stop the thoughts of ""what if I didn't let the nerves get to me?"" I keep having whimsical nostalgia back to Christmas when I was happy and looking forward to meeting her. I know I need to move on, I know that thoughts that I'll never find the person right for me are self-defeating. I know that the date may not have been perfect for me even if it did progress further. We may not have found the same things funny, we may not have had compatible political views; we both had politically liberal listed on our dating pages, but that covers a range of viewpoints. There may have been a few things where we differed and this may have been too much of a barrier. I know that this shouldn't reflect me as a person , that id doesn't mean I am bad or that my values aren't true, but it doesn't stop my irrational self saying otherwise. I keep telling myself that I  am useless, that I am not a good person, that my values cannot be true and that I must be a weirdo. I say this because my inner anxieties cause me to worry about how she viewed me that day. I worry about how I am perceived and my anxieties try to convince me that she must have thought I am like this, it cannot be a rejection without necessarily thinking I am bad or a creep. It'll say that only those seen as bad or creepy fail to move past a coffee date and that if you were good she'd have moved to a meal at the least. It doesn't matter that my lovely friend is in a similar boat and has had several unsuccessful coffee dates over the past year, and some which have sounded much worse than mine.

I keep having whimsical nostalgia back to Christmas when I was happy and looking forward to meeting her. I know I need to move on, I know that thoughts that I'll never find the person right for me are self-defeating. I know that the date may not have been perfect for me even if it did progress further. We may not have found the same things funny, we may not have had compatible political views; we both had politically liberal listed on our dating pages, but that covers a range of viewpoints. There may have been a few things where we differed and this may have been too much of a barrier. I know that this shouldn't reflect me as a person , that id doesn't mean I am bad or that my values aren't true, but it doesn't stop my irrational self saying otherwise. I keep telling myself that I  am useless, that I am not a good person, that my values cannot be true and that I must be a weirdo. I say this because my inner anxieties cause me to worry about how she viewed me that day. I worry about how I am perceived and my anxieties try to convince me that she must have thought I am like this, it cannot be a rejection without necessarily thinking I am bad or a creep. It'll say that only those seen as bad or creepy fail to move past a coffee date and that if you were good she'd have moved to a meal at the least. It doesn't matter that my lovely friend is in a similar boat and has had several unsuccessful coffee dates over the past year, and some which have sounded much worse than mine. The irrational chatter is ever present. So, thank-you for bearing with this long post.  Has anyone got any suggestions on how to deal with consistent ruminations and self-analysis which is ever critical and doesn't let me move on? How can I convince my inner critic that not being successful here does not make me a bad person or a creep?  All these thoughts do is fill me with anxiety, melancholy and a lack of motivation to do my work. ","  thanks for responding back anxious. the Richmond fellowship i think would offer you phone counselling, oh and it's free!        ",As it didn t it has left me attacking myself for not being who I thought I was and worrying about how people view me  thinking they must think badly of me  be it of my character  values  intelligence or whatever. However  as I feel like could have been less nervous and could have spoke about better things in a more nuanced way than I did  which has led to me dwelling on what might have been if I had been more at ease and gave an impression of myself which brought out my best traits. I know that I wouldn t do anything creepy or obsessive  I have seen her around since and have done nothing untoward and wouldn t do.

You aren't the first person to do this and you won't be the last, but like all the others you need to discover something  in yourself that can make you feel happy.

But it does have its plus points at the end. It brings out your independent side, which not only will have a more positive effect on your own opinion of yourself but will also have a positive influence on any future admirers, maybe even your ex. Although to be honest if she cant do the decent and respectful thing of explaining herself she doesn't sound like too big a loss, and maybe, just maybe, fighting your depression on your own may just bring the opportunity to come across someone that is better suited for you. It will hurt and it will be hard as hell. But you will get past it.

","  I completely disagree with John's reply as it seems clear you didn't marry for financial security but for love. I think that idea must come from a stereotype he has. I can quite understand why you feel so trapped as it does seem you have slotted into a prearranged place in his life and have lost your own identity in the process. It's hard enough being a wife and mother without being subsumed by it as we women are always taught that we must put everyone else's needs first or we are a bad wife and mother and selfish. You need to take your own needs seriously and find places where you can just be yourself. That could be in a work or social context, but it is vital you do this.

And this time I'm feeling so alone and helpless. I am not even functioning properly these days. I keep on convincing myself that I am okay. I'll be okay. But I am not! ","  I'm sure that there are many of us, who like you, suffer with these kinds of problems.Looking back across my 70 plus years, I now know that I've had  anxious depression compounded by hyper-vigilance for as long as I can remember, and certainly back to when I was aged 6. In reality I believe this was caused by the behaviour of my somewhat mercurial mother, a single mother, who undoubtedly also suffered anxious depression all her life.Until relatively recently I didn't know what these various conditions were or how they could affect people, much less what could be done about them. My first understanding of anxious depression came at age 24 or 5 and took me out of work for several weeks, though I never received a diagnosis, other than ""It's probably just stress!"" It was from this point that the merry-go-round of recycling thoughts first troubled me.It's recurred in acute form more times than I can remember, but usually diminished when I have been taken, or have taken myself, out of situations that caused me stress.Of course it's important to recognise that what causes you stress, is almost certainly not be the same for me. There's no universal situation or set of factors which causes everyone's stress, as you've no doubt discovered. Most of us, me included, can cope, and indeed flourish, under a certain degree of stress. The trouble is trying to recognise when the tipping point is close, or indeed has been reached!Going back to the noise-some thoughts, my most recent problem episode, some 5 years ago, brought me into contact with a Counsellor who guided me toward meditation as one possible means of reducing what I call my ""mind-movies"" to a point where I am able to cope. I should add, in fairness to previous professionals to whomI have been referred, it (Meditation) was suggested before, though then I was unable to make it work for me. However, in my case it's not just thoughts. They're usually accompanied by, as it were, pictures. Often moving pictures, thus mind movies. I believe I first acquired the mind-movie tactic when endeavouring to solve practical problems, such identifying the cause of a fault in a motor vehicle, or how best to rewire my workshop. Sadly the use of this tactic spilled over into other situations which were not helpful. Although I won't pretend that I find is easy to meditate, I am able to achieve a level of stillness, sufficient to calm the thoughts and pictures sufficiently to give me peace and rest for a period.The other thing for which I'm thankful is that I have discovered another way of helping to achieve this condition. When I set myself to do something which demands all, or a significant proportion, of my attention, then my mind, and the thoughts are reduced close to zero. I daresay that my comments have not helped you a great deal, or at all, but I do empathise and wish you success as you deal with your condition.

It is probably something that you fear or can't accept and it might be something silly that makes no sense !It triggers the panic then quite often we become panicked by the symptoms of the panic attacks and dwell on our health.If you can solve why you had your first panic and understand why it bothered you, then you need to address it by putting it into a different prospect .Meaning that , realize it is ; not an issue no more an and it has no more relevance on you. You are safe, you are good and time has proven this. You need to change the way you think about it and accept it. Don't dwell on it.It might not even be a real thing !It could be a threat, or a decision that you made or something that hurt you, that doesn't make sense.You need to think of it differently and make reasons to accept it or change it if you can .The origin of the panic is gone... it's already past and it's time to forget.In the meantime , know this ... the majority of people suffer from anxiety some time in their life. You're normal ! It's difficult , not impossible , to work with it ! It will go away when you no longer think about it .Until you solve the origin of your panic , you need to stop thinking about panic.Panic creates chemicals in your body that make your heart pound ,your mouth dry, your body sweat. You need to distract your thoughts in order to lower those chemicals. Someone told me about tapping therapy. You tap with your finger on places of your face while you repeat phrases like ""I am a good person . I deserve to be well again. This panic is not real ... this panic is leaving.The panic is gone !... repeat all... while tapping a new location. Any ways it was a kind of meditation of positive thinking that distracted my thoughts and reduced the panic.Another thing I did was exercise so I would be tired and able to rest at ease after. I did 1-2 hours in a gym after work.Meditation ... Do you have a place that you can imagine peace , quiet and pure beauty ? Like on in a boat in a lake surrounded by cottages and trees .Just find a room where you can be alone and safe and think about your paradise and every thing in it ,item by item . Concentrate on every detail that you can imagine .Enjoy being there ! Even just a few minutes can greatly calm your panic.I also read a self help book that made me aware that I was not alone dealing with panic and that panic can be brought on by the stupidest things, things not even real and can ruin our lives if we let it.This monster is our imaginations, running full speed ,blindfolded. No wonder we're scared.Like I said you can lower your panic and maybe get rid of it but I personally had to remember ,then to rethink it and accept the thing that first brought on my panic. It was a lie from someone who I cared about ... So it wasn't even real . I just happened to find out about the lie and then everything made sense to me and my body returned to normal. I couldn't accept the lie. If I could I would have been alright.For me, 4 months... 24/7 of hell !You will beat this ! Your panic is mainly  from non real thinking and you are safe.Good luck and better times ahead ! Never give up ! .............Stephen.PS ...If you can do it without heavy meds then you're  better off but don't  put yourself at harm to avoid them either.

Anyways I spiraled out of control in rage and drinking until I dropped off all my connections  /  quit all social media, and moved into a place by myself until the pain subsided. I wouldn't say don't try it again if your both wanting to try it again, though it does have a risk of ending doubly bad, so maybe pushing through the hurt until you can make clear decisions again is best though it hurts.

"  Hi guys & girls, I've been a member on the forums for a while now nearly a year and my problem still persists. For 18 months now I have felt like I am drunk 24/7 and gets even worse around 4/5pm .The best way to describe it is being spaced out, or like I am high on some sort of drug that numbs your brain. I have no mental clarity, don't know what day or time it is ever without looking at my phone, I always feel drunk & exhausted, my vision is not blurry, but I can't see if that makes sense. It's like my brain is blocking out what my eyes are seeing ?! When I was younger I used to get this feeling for maybe an hour ? Then it would go, never knew what it was but it always went.... however now I am being stuck with it for 18 months and il be honest it's that bad I have contemplated wether to give up a few times ... you know what I mean.I have seen about 20 doctors about it & specialists, they all refuse to give me a brain scan as I don't suffer from sickness or head pain. They say it's Anxiety/ depression .I have tried Eaictalopram 15mg for 4 months and that did nothing, so I am now off it and will be trying  a new drug soon. If it was Anxiety/ depression why is it constant ?! It's not on and off I mean I've felt spaced out for a whole 18 months, I find it hard to drive, I slur my speech, I absoloutly hate it.I tried CBT where the man said he knew of people feeling spaced out but no as bad as me and no where near as long as I have.I'm 21, UK.

I cry when I take myself away from all distractions like TV or magazines or music. So I sit and do nothing, hoping that the thoughts will go away, and I hate myself for it.

First, remember that all states of well-being pass. Now about your problems with Escitalopram...  A psychiatrist would be the best person to discuss these things with. Not a GP, please. They're typically completely clueless about these things and anyway usually limited in which drugs they can prescribe directly.  20 mg is actually a very high dose, so reducing to 15 and then to 10 mg should be easy (if suicidal, see your shrink immediately).   Options:  Adding low-dose lithium (150 - 300 mg - dosages that work for many, but not harmful to your kidney. Dosages for Bipolar d. are 800 - 1200 mg) to escitalopram (especially if you reduce escitalopram first as reportedly there's a chance of serotonin syndrome) Adding bupropion to escitalopram if you're more tired and lacking motivation than sad Adding mirtazapine to escitalopram if you're prone to insomnia and/or anxiety Replacing escitalopram with duloxetine (you're still getting serotonin, but adding noradrenaline with a single drug) Combining bupropion or mirtazapine with low-dose lithium has been found efficient for refractory depression, more so than combining lithium with SSRIs (you can do that before stopping escitalopram, giving you a chance to reduce it to zero over several months)  Please write these options down and discuss them with a qualified psychiatrist who hopefully knows you. All the best!

"  I've been depressed since October last year, I don't struggle to do everyday things, i'm still managing to work part time but sometimes simple things feel really hard, like socialising for example and I often just don't do them. The root cause of my problem is quite serious anxiety that was left too long without help which has developed into depression, so I'm currently on daily beta-blockers and taking a group course on depression and anxiety to try and tackle the root of the problem first. Some days i can feel fine but other days I feel quite awful, not to mention everyday I feel completely exhausted, but power on anyway, ""putting on a fake smile"".

Everything you're doing sounds great and it's ultimately up to you whether to add antidepressants to the mix.  I would advise you to do so, remembering that sometimes there needs to be some experimentation to get the right dose and the right antidepressant. I can vouch for Citalopram (Celexa).  I've been on it for years and it has served me well. But depending on your basic disposition (over-active or under-active mind) there are two different categories of antidepressant.  SSRI like Citalopram are for people who have over-active minds and SNRI for people who are under-active.  One peps you up and the other calms you down.  I take the one that calms me down.

"  I have had clinical depression for years and I have been receiving treatment for years. I need help understanding something that I have trouble with. I also have ADHD and have been receiving the same medication without issues for years.  This is something I am incredibly ashamed of and have not admitted to my therapist yet ( i plan to in our upcoming session).  There are times when I cannot control my body or get it to do something i badly wish to do. I'm not talking about not being able to get out of bed, this is a bit different from that but my thought is that it might be related. A specific example is that i cannot put my debit card back in my wallet (i know this sounds stupid but im really struggling). i'm not concerned about holding up a line or trying to get of the way. i put it loose in my bag or in my pocket and i always lose it. i dont forget to put it back in my wallet, in fact as i hold my debit card i am actively begging myself to just put it back in my wallet. to just do it. and i cant. no matter how much effort i put into it i watch it go in my backpack loose. its not really a shortcut since i put my wallet back anyways.  its like im not in control anymore. im physically healthy and i have no movement/muscular/skeletal issues. im not impaired. another example is my phone. im not addicted to my phone, if i dont have my phone im not itching for it. in fact ive been told by  many people i need to get better at using my phone. but the few times i do use it to play a game or whatever i cant put it down. the game isnt that fun, im not enjoying myself. im not procrastinating a big project or avoiding dealing with stress. im literally not getting anything out of this experience .

Are you panicked at the time ?Or maybe day dreaming thinking about something that the situation reminds you of.  Did something  bad or scary  happen in your past and maybe the phone ,the credit card , the remote brings you back but you block it out. If so you might have PTSD and it is curbing you around those thoughts in order  to protect  you.Sometimes we are unaware of things that happened to us.I suggest that you share this problem with someone  who you trust that would never judge you.

"  Me and this boy met online last may, and have been dating since june last year. He told me within the first month that he had depression.One of the main reasons he was attracted to me was how open i was with emotions and mental health. He also liked how i was a caring and positive person (not to boast, just giving context). He's training to be a doctor, and it's been busy. He managed to fit us in for face time and calls once or a few times a week, and they were so great. We're not conventional by a long shot, but i'm a pretty independant person, so only talking by phone once or twice a week doesn't bother me, in fact, it's great! i love being distant from eachother in that way because it makes the time we spend together so wonderful.I know he's struggled since we've started, doing things such as not talking for a week, then coming back and apolagizing for his behaviour, but i still encouraged him and was there for him. I sent him messages everyday and he said it helped a lot. it made us feel closer honestly.About half way through november, he stopped talking again. i begged him to tell me what was wrong, saying i was hurting, and he finally (reluctantly) said ""george, i care about you a lot. iv'e just been out of i. idk, like i cant focus, my emotions are shot. i'm just numb to everything. idk, i cant snap out of it. i'm sorry. i'm so sorry. idk i am f*****g up and i'm sorry"".  i felt good knowing it was him and not me, so i carried on encouraging him, confident that i could be there for him with the reason he was acting distant now known to me. Also, he got put back on medication for depression at the start of november (i thought it was worth mentioning because that might affect him somehow?).Two times in November he tried to reach out, saying ""Thank you...I'm travelling Tuesday....I'd like to talk Monday if we can....I'm sorry again...Idk.""  and ""Thank you for all of this. Tomorrow i travel home. I think I'm okay. Give me one more day?"" and he didn't follow up on either of them. Didn't respond to anything, but the point is he reached out, right?He's said things such as ""I really really dont deserve you"" and ""you're absolutely wonderful"" replying to random messages iv'e sent throught december, but never followed anything up.The last message i got from him was two days before chrisrtmas, saying ""I am almost done...i miss you"" (i am almost done meaning his finals at uni). He hasn't said anything since, and he blocked me a few days ago. My heart shattered, but my rational mind just cant make sense of any of it. It just doesn't make any sense. He wont tell me anything. I KNOW he doesn't want us to end. I just know it. Deep in my heart, i know it. I'm trying to be strong, focus on myself, forget about us for a while, then try reaching out again in a few months. I dont want to give up on something so utterly wonderful. I know he doesn't want it. Before he distanced himself (which i know he did because he had a depressive period) we were absolutely fine. We'd just started face timing, rather than just calling, and we were moving forward in such an exciting direction. NOTHING at that point made me think otherwise. I feel that this is to do with him.

A counsellor can help a lot, having someone in person to talk to can help avoid anxiety that can come with depression sometimes and make you feel less alone...I am always around, you're welcome to chat me up...do you have family or friends? I have no doubt, you will find some great people on here, so don't give up!!!

","  i am always very annoyed with advice some doctors give about withdrawing from these type of drugs.with venlafaxin you cannot take it any other day at low doses as it has a very short half life (about 6 hours) which means you create a rollercoaster. the best state is a constant concentration in your blood but this is obviously not possible as almost every substance gets metabolised. there is another problem with withdrawing from these drugs. as long as one is in a range in which the serotonin transporters are occupied by about 80% or higher you do not have harsh withdrawal symptoms. but when you go lower you hit rock bottom. unfortunately this isn't a linear thing but like an exponential curve (). meaning the decreases over time have to be less and less. you cannot just half the dose each 10 days. there is a solution for the problem but not everyone tolerates it the same way.before withdrawing from venlafaxine, switch to fluoxetine (which has the longest half life of the SSRI family). this could help make a much easier withdrawal as fluctuations are minimised. however: fluoxetine is not also a norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor which means you should be at a dose of lower or equal 150mg of venlafaxine to make the switch as you might end up with withdrawal due to the noradrenalin component of venlafaxine. my advice is:  reduce by only 10% at the time and stay on that regimen until all withdrawal symptoms have subsided,if: a) no withdrawal symptoms present you may make bigger reductionsb) severe withdrawal symptoms occur you may want to make smaller reductions if you cannot get lower than a specific dose with venlafaxin, consider a switch to fluoxetin or another drug that has a longer half life e.g. sertraline. try to avoid use any other medications  regularly during the withdrawal to manage symptoms  of withdrawal such as benzodiazepins as you might create additional problems which then cannot be seperated from the withdrawal.  a book i can request is from joseph glennmullen and is called the anti-depressant solution. here he describes the strategies for withdrawal equivalent to my advice. plus he offers forms to monitor withdrawal symptoms so you get used to the routine of your individual withdrawal.

After passing of 10 times half-life almost everything is out of the system.Since fluoxetine has a much higher half-life (approximately 96 hours) a switch from fluoxetine to sertraline would be considered more critical as from sertraline to fluoxetine. Since both meds are serotonin reuptake inhibitors one wants to make sure to not add a too high concentration of SSRIs to the system. So with SSRIs that have about the same half-life one can decrease the dose of one med and start with the new med at the dose which is the biochemical-equivalent (not the mg!).Normally when SSRIs are introduced one would start at a lower dose and then increase it incrementally until the effects are within the expectation.Since you've been off the sertraline for 4 days now that would mean that you have about a quarter of your steady state dose left in your system and withdrawal symptoms could still appear later on. yet it is depending on how long you took sertraline. if only for a few weeks then you will probably not experience severe withdrawal symptoms.if you're waiting for another week you can definitely safely start with fluoxetine. otherwise if you experience withdrawal symptoms while introducing fluoxetine you might mistake these as a side-effects of the fluoxetine yet in fact you can't know whether it's from sertraline or fluoxetine. this is why i recommend to wait for sure that you don't have withdrawal from sertraline and then introduce fluoxetine.do you mind me asking why you're switching from sertraline to fluoxetine?- did the sertraline not generate the effects you were hoping for?- or did you have side-effects?- what is your indication (depression, anxiety, ...?, how strongly affected is your daily living by your symptoms?)- how long did you take sertraline? it can take up to 8 weeks for the effects to kick in. sometimes an increase in dosage can do the trick. although one should always take only as much as necessary.kind regards,dps: i ask these questions because in my opinion antidepressants are overprescribed and many people start with them at a young age for various, often not severe enough reasons, take them for years and then have trouble coming off the medication. then they're diagnosed with relapsing episodes, yet often these are withdrawal/adjustment symptoms, and are told they have to take the medication for life.¬†        ",  I was on   mg of Sertraline  I have gone  cold turkey  without any withdrawal symptoms.

I have experienced this exactly, I've been on anti-depressants for 15 years and the Dr. that prescribed my first one told me I would 'probably' be on them for the rest of my life. I have been on most, if not all, anti-depressants out there (except the ones my insurance doesn't cover). I don't feel like I have gotten much benefit from them.¬† In fact, I have definitely gotten worse over time. I slowly. very slowly, came off of my anti-depressants in 2010 and was immediately suicidal. I went straight to the emergency room once I knew I was on the brink because I had formulated a plan. So, I have been on my meds again ever since. I agree with you that it is hard to come off these meds. I would go even further and say that if you are on them for a long time, I think they change the chemistry of your brain. I personally feel like a living experiment because there are no long-term studies regarding the changes in a person's brain over long-time use of these drugs, especially in combination with other anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti-anxiety meds.¬†Anyway, I came on here with a similar question about switching from zoloft to prozac. I've tried both many times, but I've been so depressed lately I knew I needed a change (my belief is that your body/brain get tolerant to certain drugs as time goes by and they don't work well anymore - I don't know if this is true, just my experience.My doctor gave me no instruction on how to switch this time. I was on 200mg of Zoloft per day & he prescribed me 40mg of prozac. So, it's been 2 days and I haven't taken any Zoloft (and don't feel the normal side effects when i missed a dose in the past - like fuzzy head, i call it sandbox head).¬† And I started taking the Prozac in its place. I feel like I should have done this differently.I feel a rush of an adrenaline-type feeling on the Prozac, maybe energy. But it is somewhat uncomfortable, but not uncomfortable enough that I don't want to take it.¬† I take alot of other medications and vitamins, so it's hard to figure out how the meds are interacting with each other.I'm going to call my pharmacist, who is really great. Let me know what your thoughts are on switching quickly like I did, and if you think I should still take some of the Zoloft with the Prozac.Thanks        ",  I was on   mg of Sertraline  I have gone  cold turkey  without any withdrawal symptoms. My GP did not specify how long after stopping the Sertraline  I should start the Fluoxetine.Has anyone any previous experience with switching  how long should I wait?  I m     if that matters

First I kept ignoring it until recently I decided to consult my GP. He has prescribed Sertraline again !!!!!

"  Hello all I have been on and off citalopram for years- my latest antidepressant was sertraline. I have just weaned myself off it after about 5 months on it.I felt terrible on it- awful digestive side effects, nightmares, more anxious than off it etc- and with my doctors supervision the plan was to switch to fluoxetine.However- i have been offered a job abroad for three months which is brilliant news. However- i leave in 3 weeks and i am only due to start fluoxotine this coming thursday. I will be in europe- im not sure how accessing the fluoxotine would work or if my doc in the UK would be happy to issue me with a 3 month supply straight off the bat.Part of me is considering not starting the medication.ive been feeling down the last few days on no medication at all- but i did feel like the dark thoughts were worse on the sertraline.im in two minds over this. I felt terrible on sertraline and kept going with it as i kept being told it would kick in. However- citalopram worked fine for years until it stopped.Im so scared that the fluoxtine will effect me the same way as sertraline did- essentially making me want to end it all.I suppose having a chat with the doctor is the best course of action but just wondering if anyone has any perspective on this. Thank you allx ","  hi Rebecca, well done posting on here firstly! i need to then congratulate you again because you have a job abroad. is it the type of job you want to do? it could be the thing you need! you may not need ANY antidepressants at all whilst you're abroad. is there any way you can do some mindfulness? i know it's not for everyone but neither are antidepressants! if you've reacted to 2 then they're obviously not agreeing to you. try every other way to sort your depression than tables! i am anti antidepressants because i have had awful experience with them. i wish luck on your job, this may make you feel rotten but at least you would have tried it!

In my experience, doctors tend to be very reserved about mentioning adverse side effects when prescribing medications and then have little advice to offer when it comes to managing any which occur. I am going to make an appointment with my GP, who is as helpful as a generalist can be, and also have an appointment with my excellent Psychological therapist, who is usually most supportive and gives me excellent advice about managing my long term , chronic Anxiety and Depression problems. I may also try to get another opinion from a psychiatrist before starting to take yet another medication, to make sure I'm not going into things blindly, The idea of managing my condition purely by using yoga, mindfulness etc. is, unfortunately, not possible in my case, as my issues derive from childhood (genetic and traumatic events) leading me to develop B.P.D. and generalized anxiety disorder.

It's very different from SSRIs. It raises noradrenaline, I believe, instead of serotonin. And also works on melatonin. That, however, in my case had no effect on insomnia.Unless you have insomnia, I would recommend you try bupropion instead, which also works on norepinephrine but also dopamine. Minimal withdrawal effects as well if it doesn't work out.If you think it might worsen your anxiety, google '3 Myths About Bupropion' and read the article.Best wishes        ",I ve recently had a horrific experienced withdrawing from Cymbalta   and have been to see a psychiatrist who has suggested I try Aglomelatine.

I saw- a new one for a second opinion- seemed to be ""pushing"" Aglo., and apparently he'd worked on developing it for distribution, which may explain, his enthusiasm.  Certainly, studies I've read don't seem to regard it as being superior in efficacy to other SSRI and SNRI medications. I shall look into Bupuprion. I have another psych. to see for yet another opinion in a couple of weeks, so I want to be as prepared as possible in advance.

","  Hi , It sounds to me that you have lost interest in all topics that relate to people around you, so you are no longer in the loop with any one and can't keep up on conversations. The computer can educate you and bring you upto  date.If you know what subjects  your friends and co-worker, the read articles related to those subjects and watch YouTube videos...very educational and popular.Also research your own interests . Once you have  more to share, conversations will improve.Remember ...no B.S. !If you don't  understand or know something , say so . Don't lie about it .People hate liars and will avoid you. I was avoiding my own brother's  conversations because of that , but I challenged him and eventually  he smartened up and now we share lots.Definitely,  the more you know , the more interesting  you become and the more interested in things you become.It's  rejection that can bring you down , so you want to find acceptance.If this relates to you and helps you , then please use it. Loneliness  can make life  boring and long.Don't  dwell on acceptance. It may or may not happen quickly or at all but you will soon find interests again and begin to seek new experiences.

  Lately I have been dealing with some things and my anxiety and stress has been not so good . Anyways I haven't been wanting sex  (I just haven't been interested in it lately I don't know why) or anything lately so I talked to my boyfriend about it and then he asked me if I loved him and I said of course but after that I've had this obsessive thought that I don't love him anymore and that our relationship is going to end and I'm so terrified of losing him but again I have this thought and fear that I don't love him anymore and it almost feels like my feelings are blocked and that I don't love him but deep down I know I do but I still can't shake the feeling and the thought and I get very anxious when im around him . I've talked to my mom but it still hasn't helped . I've also talked to my boyfriend about it and he's very understanding and saids nothing will happen to us . But I still get the thought that I don't want him anymore and whenever I do I feel completely broken hearted and I just wanna cry because I don't want to lose him .

I got a lot of help from people here when I was at my worst, so I try and give back and help when I can. You are so sad... I can tell. And, this is just my opinion and I may be insane... so take this how you will. LOL! ...but if youre sad, you MUST love him...or youre co- dependent.  But, caring if you care, kinda seems to sway away from co- dependency. And, Im very familar myself, with the ""not wanting sex"" thing... I have had that issue before...and it actually cost me a girlfriend. My wife and I were married long enough for her to understand. Because in reality, its just some strange, human behavior that we dont understand...Because at no time did I EVER love my wife or my girlfriend any more or less, matching up with carnal desire. I AM a guy so technically, I AM chemically different...but, Im also a guy that understands love and questioning ones self... my advise; stopTHINKING about it, we all know, love is of the heart, not the head... and stop beating yourself up for questioning your love and it mattering to you enough to come here for help...and realize... you LOVE him enough TO be sad and to come here for help.

""Just depressed"" is an oxymoron. Depression is a serious condition that can start seemingly small, over little things, and spiral into a huge black hole. Fear of contact can be one symptom of depression. Make an appointment with your doc and discuss what you are feeling. Take the bf if you want - it will help him understand too. Don't sit and wait to see what might happen - take charge and address what ails you, get back in control of your life. You will thank yourself for it.

I'm going through the exact same thing right now. I've been in a tough spot for about a year now and some days are great, some days are s**t. I've been with my bf for 2.5 years and he's been pretty patient with me when I get emotional and flip moods and whatever may happen. I feel like I just don't recognize myself anymore, and that makes me not recognize him either. I look in the mirror sometimes and have no idea who I am anymore, and then I look at him and he feels like a stranger. It's also like that with a lot of people in my life though. I think it's so difficult because these people are the closest should feel the most secure, and it's terrifying when they don't. It's great that you guys are still communicating though, it helps a lot when people you love know exactly how/what you're feeling . I worry we don't communicate enough anymore. I'm pretty quiet nowadays, but I tell him how I feel if I feel strong enough...I think he just doesn't know what to say or do most of the time because he doesn't wanna make things worse for me. We've had so many fun times and I know my thoughts are just cloudy and dark, so it's hard to remember stuff like that. I'm the same as you, in the way that it would break my heart if we weren't together, but sometimes I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm bored, but then I remember I have no interest in anything. You're probably going through a phase of depression...it's not hard to feel emotionally detached sometimes. Just by reading this post and the responses I feel comforted knowing that there are other people out there struggling with the same problems...not because it makes me happy, but because it makes me feel less alone. I hope everyday it gets a little less confusing & you get more confident in your relationship again!

  Lately I have been dealing with some things and my anxiety and stress has been not so good . Anyways I haven't been wanting sex  (I just haven't been interested in it lately I don't know why) or anything lately so I talked to my boyfriend about it and then he asked me if I loved him and I said of course but after that I've had this obsessive thought that I don't love him anymore and that our relationship is going to end and I'm so terrified of losing him but again I have this thought and fear that I don't love him anymore and it almost feels like my feelings are blocked and that I don't love him but deep down I know I do but I still can't shake the feeling and the thought and I get very anxious when im around him . I've talked to my mom but it still hasn't helped . I've also talked to my boyfriend about it and he's very understanding and saids nothing will happen to us . But I still get the thought that I don't want him anymore and whenever I do I feel completely broken hearted and I just wanna cry because I don't want to lose him . I feel so lost and confused I don't know anymore am I just depressed or what is going on? I feel so lonely and upset.  I don't wanna be with anyone else I can't even imagine it I just want him but I'm just so confused and I don't know what to do ..  ,"  i am going thru something a lot similar. i recently got really bad anxiety and it spikes everytime my boyfriend and i fight or argue. i know deep down i can not be falling out of love but its so hard to not believe it with my anxiety and i think my depression might be coming back. he is so amazing and before the anxiety started i never ever pictured myself falling out of love with him. even feel like this, all i ever want to do is be with him and being with him makes me feel great thats why this is so frustrating. i talk to him about it and he says its okay we will always be together and this isnt your fault you feel like this and he always makes me feel better. he is the only person that can make me feel better and thats why i am so lost because if i was falling out of love i wouldnt constantly want to talk and be around him.

I would guess not because in my experience they will do anything to avoid blaming medication and thus offending and compromising the pharmaceuticals by whom they are owned.        ,i have noticed lately i have shortness of breathe and also feeling very  nauseous. what can this be?

Tell  this family member about everything, you may feel like you're betraying him but this will help you're boyfriend. His family member will be taking care of him and checking in.

"  Hello all, I'll be off to the doctors within the next week or so but wanted to get some ideas from others before I do. I've only recently been going to a new doctors surgery after returning home after a period of studying/ working away.   In the few short months I've been at this surgery I've been back so many times and I'm starting to feel I'm not being listened to. (Background: I was on citalopram on and off between ages 19- 21. Had some counselling at Uni. Aged about 22 went back on citalopram for a bit and have been off medication since starting sertraline in September this year. I'm now 23) I'm not sure how best to go about medication now.  Started in september on 100mg sertraline, did nothing, early december i went onto 150mg and feel worse than i have in my whole life. I've been on to group cbt 'stress control group'  over the past 10 weeks or so and I am now on the waiting list for NHS CBT (in my area it will be a 6 month waiting list minimum). I was seeing a private counselor where I lived for about 4 months and I have been carrying on over the phone for a further 2 months (i am considering stopping as whilst its been helpful, i feel going over past events is now turning to be depressing rather than helpful as it was at the start. I feel for now I've learnt all i need to/ can deal with and need to focus more on practical side of coping with my issues. I do have issues from my past i havent worked through yet but im getting there) But even with all this I'm still feeling terrible. Constant anxiety, disturbed sleep (which in my years of anxiety/depression i've never suffered with),  thoughts of ending it all. And I do think sertraline has made it all worse. Im trying self guided cbt books, exercise etc to no avail. Does anyone have any tales of hope they can share ?

Thanks for reading- just feeling really confused and dont know what to do next x ","  Hi there,I don't normally post on here but your story sounded so much like mine that I just had to.It sounds like you've had a very similar experience to me when taking sertraline and citalopram.I originally went on medication to help with anxiety but found that it was just making me  feel more and more depressed. My sleeping pattern ended up being all over the place, I was so tearful and withdrawn and stopped going to university. The worst part was when i went to the doctors and told them the medication was making me worse they didn't listen and wanted to put me on a higher dose. Eventually I had enough and gradually stopped taking the medication. It was the best decision I've ever made and I've felt so much better since. I now focus on methods to deal with my anxiety my self, I think medication can sometimes just mask the underlying problem.Obviously everyone is different but that's just what I found helped me.

Whilst I was on medication I also felt I couldn't tell what emotions were mine and what the medication was making me feel if that makes sense.From my experience too some of the worst advice that was ever given to me came from the various doctor I saw. I know they're probably trained in all of this but when they've not been through it themselves some doctors arent the most understanding and just seem to follow what the text book tells them. This will sound so cheesy but I did a lot of soul searching and found the only way to get myself out of the funk I was in was to deal with the issues I had. I think I've come to accept now that my anxiety will never completely go away but I've learnt to work with it rather than letting it get the better of me.All the best, I really hope you can overcome your anxiety too.

Had some counselling at Uni. Aged about 22 went back on citalopram for a bit and have been off medication since starting sertraline in September this year. I'm now 23) I'm not sure how best to go about medication now.  Started in september on 100mg sertraline, did nothing, early december i went onto 150mg and feel worse than i have in my whole life. I've been on to group cbt 'stress control group'  over the past 10 weeks or so and I am now on the waiting list for NHS CBT (in my area it will be a 6 month waiting list minimum). I was seeing a private counselor where I lived for about 4 months and I have been carrying on over the phone for a further 2 months (i am considering stopping as whilst its been helpful, i feel going over past events is now turning to be depressing rather than helpful as it was at the start. I feel for now I've learnt all i need to/ can deal with and need to focus more on practical side of coping with my issues. I do have issues from my past i havent worked through yet but im getting there) But even with all this I'm still feeling terrible. Constant anxiety, disturbed sleep (which in my years of anxiety/depression i've never suffered with),  thoughts of ending it all. And I do think sertraline has made it all worse. Im trying self guided cbt books, exercise etc to no avail. Does anyone have any tales of hope they can share ?  Is it worth asking to be moved onto a different class of antidepressants rather than SSRI? I felt citalopram helped somewhat with low mood but generally left me feeling like a complete zombie and didnt stop my sudden and severe low moods. Thanks for reading- just feeling really confused and dont know what to do next x ","  hi Rebecca, after my last dangerous reaction to ssri's i have vowed never EVER to take them again, it doesn't matter how ill i get. try mindfulness, yoga, Pilates, walking, talking therapies, ANYTHING but this rubbish that has been given out for years like smarties! ask people on here that drug is awful. i wish you luck. p.m me if you want to, i promise i will listen and won't judge....

Thanks for reading- just feeling really confused and dont know what to do next x ","  There are lots of options for treating depression so don't give up! Don't worry about going to your GP a lot. I went almost daily when I was feeling bad! Firstly make sure your doctor has checked for organic causes... hyperthyroidism, anemia etc. If these tests are negative, there are loads of antidepressants you can try. SSRIs, SNRIs, mirtazapine, buproprion, MAOIs, antipsycotics etc.  I would give each medication 6 to 8 weeks to see if it works; if not ask to try another. I had success with Venlafaxine which is an SNRI rather than an SSRI.   Had about 10 years with no major problems with anxiety or depression. Only 30% of people respond fully to the first antidepressant they try but after trying lots of different ones 70% achieve full remission and the others a significant reduction in their symptoms.

Some people will also respond to medication fatter than  others. Six  weeks in is a  little too early to give up.  Sertraline takes  at least 6-8  weeks to  start working.

  so ill try make a long story short as possible I‚Äôm 32 and my husband is 38 together 13 years married 7. I feel like my marriage was over the day i was diagnosed with depression about 18 months ago i remember coming home from the doctors with my new pack of antidepressants walked in to my husband who was watching tv and told him doctor said i have depression and put me on medication he looked at me and laughed and said sure what have you to be depressed over. I suffered silently for about 4 month after that he never once mentioned the depression to me. Just over four months I broke down to him because I didn‚Äôt want to go to work I had an incident where my sisters boyfriend came on to me at a party and she blamed me for it and stopped speaking to me the 3 of us work in the same job. I fell into major depression over that me and my sister were always like best friends and the one time I really needed her she left me and even told me to get over myself everyone has down days. Depression got so bad I didn‚Äôt get out of bed for days even lost interest in my own kids they would come into my room to show me something from school or tell me something and all I could think to myself was just go away. One really bad day I decided I had enough I had no one and my kids were better off without me I sat at the kitchen table with lots of different pills and a bottle of vodka I was in the strangest mind frame and suddenly my daughter walked into the kitchen asking for a drink she woke up and that seemed to snap me out of what I was considering doing because then I just kept thinking of her finding me dead. Back to my husband even after all this he still didn‚Äôt seem to show any support or even ask how I was feeling and when I would try talk to him he looked so disinterested as if he wasn‚Äôt even listening or cut me off and start talking about himself. The last 6 months have been the worst he goes off on one if he comes home and the house is not clean or no dinner is made and I get a comment like are you still in bed I have explained to him on really bad days I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything but he still continues to rant about it and it ends up making me feel useless and the bad day turns into 2 or 3 days then. He would have always been used to me being fairly organized and always doing everything around the home I think it‚Äôs p****d him off so much. He annoyed me so much one day shouting about the house being filthy which was overdramatized my dog did a poo in the conservatory and I left it there for 3 days he refuses to pick up dog poo I did it just to give him something proper to actually give out about!! For a about 2 months now I have been having more good than bad days but I am starting to realize most of the bad days are hitting me over him having a bad attitude over most of the time little things and it puts a down mood in the hole house Especially on his days off work. I have stood by him through a lot over 13 years together alcoholism and tablet addiction court issues over alcohol and it‚Äôs a kick in the gut this is the only time in my life I‚Äôve needed him and its a joke in his eyes. So I decided I‚Äôm going to move to my mothers with the kids today while he‚Äôs in work it‚Äôs only 10 minutes away so he will still see the kids and see if I‚Äôm better on my own and if not I‚Äôll have to live with whatever will be but I feel I‚Äôm making the right choice. But my anxiety and depression demon are making me ask lots of questions am I being over dramatic? Is he right when he tells me I‚Äôm mad or lazy ? Is the depression after making me sensitive? I ,"  hi, i just saw this pop up in my emails and didnt want to ignore it! all i can do is give advise as i would a friend but can you not say you need some space so you are going to stay at your mums for a while? that will give you a chance to see if you feel the same when you go and also maybe make him realise he should have supported you? In my experience you know when its over, it is just hard to accept so a bit of time away may help you know for sure what you want to do? i am not excusing his lack of support but it is difficult to understand depression if you havent suffered with it. best wishes whatever happens x        ",One really bad day I decided I had enough I had no one and my kids were better off without me I sat at the kitchen table with lots of different pills and a bottle of vodka I was in the strangest mind frame and suddenly my daughter walked into the kitchen asking for a drink she woke up and that seemed to snap me out of what I was considering doing because then I just kept thinking of her finding me dead.

I know its hard to understand if you havent been there but at least try or listen is all you need from someone sometimes i did ask him a few weeks back if he could move out for a few weeks as we have two children and see if we are happier apart but it got nasty ranting about how he brings more money into the home so everything is his so looks like my only option is to go to my mam's and then ill know for sure with this depression the more he tells me im being over dramatic and childish about everything you end up questioning yourself        ,One really bad day I decided I had enough I had no one and my kids were better off without me I sat at the kitchen table with lots of different pills and a bottle of vodka I was in the strangest mind frame and suddenly my daughter walked into the kitchen asking for a drink she woke up and that seemed to snap me out of what I was considering doing because then I just kept thinking of her finding me dead.

But my anxiety and depression demon are making me ask lots of questions am I being over dramatic? Is he right when he tells me I‚Äôm mad or lazy ? Is the depression after making me sensitive? I ,"  Hi,This is so sad and I'm really sorry you're having to go through this. I would suggest your husband doesn't understand what your depression is doing to you and how alone you must feel.He has been insensitive to your sate of mind yes, and may not understand the pain you are in. He may also be fearful and this is why he is choosing to ignore your situation and covering it up with a hard line tactic of being upset by trivialities. Though the importance in all of this is for you to get well. Some may think, get well for your children and your marriage and that is important however, you need to get well for you and you alone. You seem to be a very reasonable person who works and looks after your children, your husband and your home. My question would be if you also work, why are you left to clean house? Why is it just your duty to pick up dog poo?  I think from what you have said, there is an imbalance of shared responsibilities in the home and could be causing underlying tensions. It is so hard when family (your sister) has turned away from you, people do the most hurtful things to others before they will see the truth. If her boyfriend came on to you then it is her who needs a wake up call, not you. I'd say please stop thinking of everyone else and look to get well for you first. We all to often think about people far too much which further compounds our anxiety through fears of rejection and or abandonment.Give your husband the option,  ask if he will go to the doctor with you so they can let him understand the severity of what you're going through. If he refuses, then you have little choice but to concentrate on you to get well. Don't do this as a punishment exercise to him, see it as a necessity to feel better for you alone. Depression can make us think irrationally at times, and can have a devastating impact. Sit for a min, think of what it is you really want and don't allow others to tell you what to do, this is your life and you're the only one living in it. Go for a walk, a cuppa, be kinder to yourself, it will calm you a little and hopefully you will gain some clarity.  You are right to want to have space and it doesn't mean you need to feel even worse by making rash decisions.  If after you still want to leave, talk to your husband and let him know what you are intending to do. Leaving without talking will add fuel to what is already a traumatic time for you. People in here care, please keep in touch.        ",One really bad day I decided I had enough I had no one and my kids were better off without me I sat at the kitchen table with lots of different pills and a bottle of vodka I was in the strangest mind frame and suddenly my daughter walked into the kitchen asking for a drink she woke up and that seemed to snap me out of what I was considering doing because then I just kept thinking of her finding me dead. The last   months have been the worst he goes off on one if he comes home and the house is not clean or no dinner is made and I get a comment like are you still in bed I have explained to him on really bad days I can t bring myself to do anything but he still continues to rant about it and it ends up making me feel useless and the bad day turns into   or   days then. I have stood by him through a lot over    years together alcoholism and tablet addiction court issues over alcohol and it s a kick in the gut this is the only time in my life I ve needed him and its a joke in his eyes.
  so ill try make a long story short as possible I‚Äôm 32 and my husband is 38 together 13 years married 7. I feel like my marriage was over the day i was diagnosed with depression about 18 months ago i remember coming home from the doctors with my new pack of antidepressants walked in to my husband who was watching tv and told him doctor said i have depression and put me on medication he looked at me and laughed and said sure what have you to be depressed over. I suffered silently for about 4 month after that he never once mentioned the depression to me. Just over four months I broke down to him because I didn‚Äôt want to go to work I had an incident where my sisters boyfriend came on to me at a party and she blamed me for it and stopped speaking to me the 3 of us work in the same job. I fell into major depression over that me and my sister were always like best friends and the one time I really needed her she left me and even told me to get over myself everyone has down days. Depression got so bad I didn‚Äôt get out of bed for days even lost interest in my own kids they would come into my room to show me something from school or tell me something and all I could think to myself was just go away. One really bad day I decided I had enough I had no one and my kids were better off without me I sat at the kitchen table with lots of different pills and a bottle of vodka I was in the strangest mind frame and suddenly my daughter walked into the kitchen asking for a drink she woke up and that seemed to snap me out of what I was considering doing because then I just kept thinking of her finding me dead. Back to my husband even after all this he still didn‚Äôt seem to show any support or even ask how I was feeling and when I would try talk to him he looked so disinterested as if he wasn‚Äôt even listening or cut me off and start talking about himself. The last 6 months have been the worst he goes off on one if he comes home and the house is not clean or no dinner is made and I get a comment like are you still in bed I have explained to him on really bad days I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything but he still continues to rant about it and it ends up making me feel useless and the bad day turns into 2 or 3 days then. He would have always been used to me being fairly organized and always doing everything around the home I think it‚Äôs p****d him off so much. He annoyed me so much one day shouting about the house being filthy which was overdramatized my dog did a poo in the conservatory and I left it there for 3 days he refuses to pick up dog poo I did it just to give him something proper to actually give out about!!

I ,  thank you so much for taking the time in your reply you have made me feel like my mind is right in how im feeling and im not just being over dramatic like i keep being told you start to question yourself when your always being told your mad and not the only one with problems by the people who should be there for you. i am very lucky to have my mam who suffered with depression years ago so she understands me even if what im saying sounds crazy but instead of being happy i have her i am constantly worry about having no one when shes not around anymore..  as for me doing everything at home thats my fault as i always just did it and never complained you dont realize how people can just end up expecting it of you then. I am  always reminded the dogs are mine and my problem they would be lucky  to get fed if i wasnt around i love my dogs though id happily pick up there poo all day long there more loyal than any human        ,One really bad day I decided I had enough I had no one and my kids were better off without me I sat at the kitchen table with lots of different pills and a bottle of vodka I was in the strangest mind frame and suddenly my daughter walked into the kitchen asking for a drink she woke up and that seemed to snap me out of what I was considering doing because then I just kept thinking of her finding me dead.

I ,"  Hi hun,I had to reply as I have been trying to support my husband for the last 4 years regarding his mental health, and he decided that Christmas 2019 that he could no longer be the reason for my unhappiness. We have a nearly 10 year old daughter together and have been married for 12 years, together 18 years. Everything you have said sounds very much like us. I live for my daughter and even though I absolutely adore my husband, unfortunately he is not the man I married and is in some way broken. I have given it my all, even through difficult times, but sometimes it's easier to agree to separate. The children will still be seen by both parties and you can both start to try and love yourselves once again.

  so ill try make a long story short as possible I‚Äôm 32 and my husband is 38 together 13 years married 7. I feel like my marriage was over the day i was diagnosed with depression about 18 months ago i remember coming home from the doctors with my new pack of antidepressants walked in to my husband who was watching tv and told him doctor said i have depression and put me on medication he looked at me and laughed and said sure what have you to be depressed over. I suffered silently for about 4 month after that he never once mentioned the depression to me. Just over four months I broke down to him because I didn‚Äôt want to go to work I had an incident where my sisters boyfriend came on to me at a party and she blamed me for it and stopped speaking to me the 3 of us work in the same job. I fell into major depression over that me and my sister were always like best friends and the one time I really needed her she left me and even told me to get over myself everyone has down days. Depression got so bad I didn‚Äôt get out of bed for days even lost interest in my own kids they would come into my room to show me something from school or tell me something and all I could think to myself was just go away. One really bad day I decided I had enough I had no one and my kids were better off without me I sat at the kitchen table with lots of different pills and a bottle of vodka I was in the strangest mind frame and suddenly my daughter walked into the kitchen asking for a drink she woke up and that seemed to snap me out of what I was considering doing because then I just kept thinking of her finding me dead.

"  Hello there,I have been together with my girlfriend just under a year now. With our anniversary coming up soon.  We both had some stress the last few months, I have moved house. She is switching jobs. During the past year when she was feeling down, she sometimes wanted her space, and sometimes wanted me to stay and keep her company.It all started a couple weeks ago, as I was moving into my new home...the last time we saw each other was during Christmas. She didn't fell well after and a little me time (which was partly the job switching and a cold).

This is my experience with 5+ long term relationships, need space/take a break generally means they want out of the relationship, and you don't want to cling at something that isn't there. It may not be touchy feely advice for someone with depression, but I've been through it and see it in other relationships today, go find some else who wants and deserves your time. Dragging out a break up will only lead to cheating, more pain, no thank you.

My personal opinion is not too much.  It's only natural that some of the issues of a depressed person who is in a relationship have to do with that relationship so a third party would be necessary, a therapist. Is it possible for you to withdraw your concern and allow this thing to play out however it's going to go without trying to obtain satisfaction for yourself? I know we're only human and unable to give up our attachment to getting the results we want, but it would be so much more comfortable for you to withdraw a little if you can.

With all due respect I just need to say again that I feel this is a toxic relationship for you which is draining you dry and, if you're like I was, you're using this relationship as a way of avoiding self-care and self-development. You will so thank yourself later in life if you can find the strength and courage to break away. I never did break away from my unhealthy relationships and I can tell you that, as a result, I've ruined my whole life. Please don't do what I did.  Break away and spend some time alone dealing with yourself and your own issues.  The results will be a wonderful future for you.

Then and only then will they be ready for a relationship that's healthy and ready to pick a partner who's not going to sabotage their growth and development. I'm sorry but your relationship doesn't sound like healthy one.  The reason I know this is because every single partner I've ever had has been very, very unhealthy for me and I used relationships to avoid being alone and dealing with my problems.

I've come to accept that no matter what mental health awareness campaigns there are, in my lifetime depression will never be recognized and treated as a serious medical issue, and confiding in some to tell them I have bouts of crippling depression just alienates me. Makes me the butt of a jokes, cause I don't go out drinking constantly, which just snowballs into worsening depression that I'll probably take to my grave.

"  I don't know how common this is, but I have a specific fear of dying young. I don't mind death when I'm old and have passed on the baton of life to my younger ones, but I fear I'll die young. I have been terrified of stories where healthy people abruptly get cardiac arrests or other such sudden things. I fear I'll leave my future wife and kids and that they'll have to suffer because of me. I feel I am fairly healthy, a bit underweight perhaps. I've never had any major operations, surgeries or any other serious medical conditions. Still it terrifies me to imagine myself committing my life with a partner and possibly having a family, and then suddenly leaving them on their own. I often pray to God that he either takes me away now when really nobody is dependent on me, or takes me away at an old age when nobody needs to be dependent on me. I just pray that he doesn't take me away at a time when my family needs me the most. But obviously I know I can't control my own death (I don't support suicide at all). It just terrifies me a lot and sometimes I feel it'll be better if I don't marry anyone at all so that nobody, neither my wife nor my kids, have to depend on me.

So don't stress, when it's time your mind will kick into acceptance mode, I fortunately didn't end up dying though but I know what the cusp is like and there is nothing to be scared of. Death is just a natural part of life.        ",I often pray to God that he either takes me away now when really nobody is dependent on me  or takes me away at an old age when nobody needs to be dependent on me. It just terrifies me a lot and sometimes I feel it ll be better if I don t marry anyone at all so that nobody  neither my wife nor my kids  have to depend on me. I fear I ll leave my future wife and kids and that they ll have to suffer because of me.
"  I don't know how common this is, but I have a specific fear of dying young. I don't mind death when I'm old and have passed on the baton of life to my younger ones, but I fear I'll die young. I have been terrified of stories where healthy people abruptly get cardiac arrests or other such sudden things. I fear I'll leave my future wife and kids and that they'll have to suffer because of me. I feel I am fairly healthy, a bit underweight perhaps. I've never had any major operations, surgeries or any other serious medical conditions. Still it terrifies me to imagine myself committing my life with a partner and possibly having a family, and then suddenly leaving them on their own. I often pray to God that he either takes me away now when really nobody is dependent on me, or takes me away at an old age when nobody needs to be dependent on me. I just pray that he doesn't take me away at a time when my family needs me the most. But obviously I know I can't control my own death (I don't support suicide at all). It just terrifies me a lot and sometimes I feel it'll be better if I don't marry anyone at all so that nobody, neither my wife nor my kids, have to depend on me. But I do want to marry someone and start a family with her. I want to have a wife that I love with all my heart and have lovely kids with her. I want to live a normal stable life with my family, but that damned fear makes me nervous about my future. I know I might be over-thinking about this stupid fear of mine, but it's affecting me on a psychological level. I am anyways in depression currently and it doesn't help if this fear stops me from dreaming about a better future. I need some help regarding how to tackle this fear. I am twenty years old. I have never had a girlfriend, and probably will never have one. But I'm pretty sure I'll eventually get arranged to a girl and that's fine with me, as long as I'm happy with her and she's happy with me. Any advice or experience will definitely help me get a clearer idea about this issue. ","  Having a fear of dying early sounds like a symptom of anxiety.  But it's also a symptom of being a sensitive young person. If I remember correctly you are the one who cannot seek professional treatment for various reasons. I will just say, gently, that I wish there were some way you come clean to your parents or whoever can help you to get treatment.  Anxiety medication would work wonders for your ‚Äòfears of early death‚Äô.  An antidepressant would help with your low self-image and social anxiety. I do remember when I was your age having all kinds of scary fears about things other people probably didnt even think about, and I was also hyper-aware of my physical flaws.  This all passes with time. We‚Äôre very sensitive people and have great depth and that‚Äôs one of the reasons we‚Äôre afflicted the way we are. I‚Äôve spoken to you in another post about things to do to calm and reassure yourself. But please know this kind of scary place you‚Äôre in emotionally is temporary and it will pass, probably in plenty of time for you to marry and have a normal relationship.

  I just dont know how to carry on I hate myself and my life ,"  Dear Bikerjools, I know the feeling and I spent a brief period of my life on the bed unable to get up.  But for me the spell was broken when my brother told me about having goals.  Just babystep goals really.  One little thing you can accomplish for that day will be enough to raise your spirits a bit.  Then once you get the gist of it you can begin to do more than one thing. For me the goal I found that saved me was to work on a painting every day.  I'm an artist and had abandoned it for a time. Before long my spirits had returned to normal and I had a lot of enthusiasm for life and even was able to do a short run in the morning before settling down with my coffee to work on a painting.  And I've been painting all my life ever since then and it sustains me and makes me a happy person.        ",None

"  Hello all, I'm going to apologize from the start because I know this will be all sorts of messy and maybe confusing. I've been with my bf  for 5 years. Things were going relatively good until something horrible happened that caused us to move from where we lived into a new place but together. Despite the horrible circumstances, I was excited for us to live together. Little did I know all the stress and hard times that were going to come with this. My bf was still very sad and torn apart about what happened and although he had every right to feel that way, his negativity was starting to stress me out. I suddenly felt like I couldn't handle the situation we were in, I felt guilty because it was my idea to move and I didn't know how to take care of him or make him feel better. After a while I just felt trapped in a s****y situation. I'll make this part of the story short. I began a new job and in that job I started getting attracted to a coworker. Needless to say after a few months I ended up cheating on my bf with said coworker. At first I kept blaming my bf but I came to realize it was all my greediness. The craving of wanting something new, stress free, where things were fun and I got to feel desire again. Crushing on this coworker also made me feel like I'd have a backup if all went wrong with my bf so I was really feeding and going all into it. This coworker ended up finding a new job and with that the cheating ended. For a while I didn't feel bad but all of a sudden I started panicking. I felt disgusted with myself. I confessed to my bf and after many long discussions and talks here we are still together. We moved to a new place again and things here are going much better.  My bf has forgiven me but I can't seem to forgive myself. I know everything I did pretty much classifies me as a worthless b***h but I really do love my bf. I enjoy taking care of us, I feel so much comfort and peace when I lay in his arms. The problem is that now usually at night I can't stop overthinking. I know I love him but my thoughts say ""you don't love him, you wouldn't have done what you did"", every time I try to calm down and take control of my thoughts I feel like its me vs my head. I don't know what's real anymore. When I remind myself that things are better now my thoughts are like ""you're just forcing this to work"" and honestly I just have so many similar horrible thoughts, my thoughts always have something to answer back with when I'm trying to reason with myself. I dont think I have multiple personality disorder but there's so many thoughts going on at the same time and I cant control them. I feel so aware of my thoughts, if that makes any sense, that its driving me insane. I just want to be happy again. I want to be happy with my bf. I want to put things in the past and become a better person. I want to include a little more history about us and my past. When I confessed to my bf about my physical and emotional infidelity with my coworker, I realized a lot of things I did wrong in the past as well. Things I thought were no big deal like flirting because I've sorta always been flirty. I also have a huge need of male attention, I always want them to find me attractive or desire me. I fantasize about other people a lot too. About anyone really, even if I dont find them attractive I'll sometimes fantasize. I feel like a sick person. I really dont understand why I'm like this. When I was younger and had my first bf he ended up cheating on me, I forgave him. A while after I got really sick and was diagnosed with an auto immune disorder. The medications I had to take for this really messed a lot with my appearance. Being as young as I was and in high school it really took a toll on me. I broke up with that bf because I noticed he wasn't attracted to me anymore and I couldn't blame him. After that all I wanted was to feel beautiful again, that's when I started being really flirty and creating a sex appeal. I'd fool around, kiss or whatever anyone because those few minutes made me feel better, like I was desired and attractive. It was also my escape from issues that were going on at home since my father was a drug addict (he's now clean and doing better). I lost a lot of friends because I became really bitchy and angry at the world over everything that has happening to me and in my life. After a few years my older sister was pregnant from her bf but her bf would always be flirty with me. Trust me when I say, that's NOT something I wanted. I would try ignoring him but at a point when I'd go to their house so I could spend time with MY sister, he'd try touching me when she left the room. I was still underage and I didn't know what to do. Keep in mind, I was about 16 or 17 and this man was either in his late 30's or 40's. I finally broke down and told my parents everything when he tried jerking off being next to me, besides that he had pulled open my shirt and spanked me on different occasions. My parents are old school to the point where they said its my fault for how I dress and sometimes people make mistakes so they were going to talk directly to him but never mentioned it to my sister. They ended up getting married...then divorcing because she cheated on him (she still doesnt know up to this point what happened) and now they're back together. Speaking of my sister, when I was much younger and she was in highschool, she attempted to commit suicide, was addicted to pot (you know, when pot was still a big deal) and was dealing with her sexuality so things at home were not good. I would always be in my room crying from hearing the arguements between my parents and her. I know this is a very long post but I wanted to give information about my errors, the actual mental things I'm now feeling and a little history about my background/personality/where I come from. I'm I just permanently f****d up over all the chaos that went on in my pre-teen/teenage years? Does my past have nothing to do with my issues and I'm actually just a horrible person? Even though I know couples have survived infidelity by putting in the work to better the relationship, why do I feel like mine has no chance of surviving? If I KNOW I love my bf, why does my mind question and deny it? Will I ever be able to control my thoughts? Is this a case of obsessing over intrusive thoughts? Is there any way my past connects with all of this? Does it get better? I'm so tired of staying up because I feel like I'm having a panic attack. Negative thoughts, heart pounding, sweating, indigestion and sometimes vomiting. My bf is my best friend, I want to grow old with him, when the times are good they are GOOD and oh my god nothing feels better than being in his arms. I know that after what I did I should feel guilt but this is honestly getting to a point where I'm scared of myself and my thoughts. ","  whilst im not in your situation my ex broke things off with me coz he didnt know how he felt and still doesnt (i believe due to depression)i havent been through half the things you have in life however i fan relate to the thoughts over taking, my head bounces from one side to the other on the exact same subject and i dont know how to make them stop.i do actually think its a sign of depression or anxiety and i have started counselling because i to self sabbotaged my relationship with my ex (not by cheating but by letting myself believe the negative thoughts and grilling him on it)when you overthink like we do, generally they are negative thoughts.maybe you should go see your dr to discuss it and try getting some counselling or something        ",When I remind myself that things are better now my thoughts are like  you re just forcing this to work  and honestly I just have so many similar horrible thoughts  my thoughts always have something to answer back with when I m trying to reason with myself.

I know I love him but my thoughts say ""you don't love him, you wouldn't have done what you did"", every time I try to calm down and take control of my thoughts I feel like its me vs my head. I don't know what's real anymore. When I remind myself that things are better now my thoughts are like ""you're just forcing this to work"" and honestly I just have so many similar horrible thoughts, my thoughts always have something to answer back with when I'm trying to reason with myself. I dont think I have multiple personality disorder but there's so many thoughts going on at the same time and I cant control them. I feel so aware of my thoughts, if that makes any sense, that its driving me insane. I just want to be happy again. I want to be happy with my bf. I want to put things in the past and become a better person. I want to include a little more history about us and my past. When I confessed to my bf about my physical and emotional infidelity with my coworker, I realized a lot of things I did wrong in the past as well. Things I thought were no big deal like flirting because I've sorta always been flirty. I also have a huge need of male attention, I always want them to find me attractive or desire me. I fantasize about other people a lot too. About anyone really, even if I dont find them attractive I'll sometimes fantasize. I feel like a sick person. I really dont understand why I'm like this. When I was younger and had my first bf he ended up cheating on me, I forgave him. A while after I got really sick and was diagnosed with an auto immune disorder. The medications I had to take for this really messed a lot with my appearance. Being as young as I was and in high school it really took a toll on me. I broke up with that bf because I noticed he wasn't attracted to me anymore and I couldn't blame him. After that all I wanted was to feel beautiful again, that's when I started being really flirty and creating a sex appeal. I'd fool around, kiss or whatever anyone because those few minutes made me feel better, like I was desired and attractive. It was also my escape from issues that were going on at home since my father was a drug addict (he's now clean and doing better). I lost a lot of friends because I became really bitchy and angry at the world over everything that has happening to me and in my life. After a few years my older sister was pregnant from her bf but her bf would always be flirty with me. Trust me when I say, that's NOT something I wanted. I would try ignoring him but at a point when I'd go to their house so I could spend time with MY sister, he'd try touching me when she left the room. I was still underage and I didn't know what to do. Keep in mind, I was about 16 or 17 and this man was either in his late 30's or 40's. I finally broke down and told my parents everything when he tried jerking off being next to me, besides that he had pulled open my shirt and spanked me on different occasions. My parents are old school to the point where they said its my fault for how I dress and sometimes people make mistakes so they were going to talk directly to him but never mentioned it to my sister. They ended up getting married...then divorcing because she cheated on him (she still doesnt know up to this point what happened) and now they're back together. Speaking of my sister, when I was much younger and she was in highschool, she attempted to commit suicide, was addicted to pot (you know, when pot was still a big deal) and was dealing with her sexuality so things at home were not good. I would always be in my room crying from hearing the arguements between my parents and her. I know this is a very long post but I wanted to give information about my errors, the actual mental things I'm now feeling and a little history about my background/personality/where I come from. I'm I just permanently f****d up over all the chaos that went on in my pre-teen/teenage years? Does my past have nothing to do with my issues and I'm actually just a horrible person? Even though I know couples have survived infidelity by putting in the work to better the relationship, why do I feel like mine has no chance of surviving? If I KNOW I love my bf, why does my mind question and deny it? Will I ever be able to control my thoughts? Is this a case of obsessing over intrusive thoughts? Is there any way my past connects with all of this? Does it get better? I'm so tired of staying up because I feel like I'm having a panic attack. Negative thoughts, heart pounding, sweating, indigestion and sometimes vomiting. My bf is my best friend, I want to grow old with him, when the times are good they are GOOD and oh my god nothing feels better than being in his arms. I know that after what I did I should feel guilt but this is honestly getting to a point where I'm scared of myself and my thoughts. ","  hi anonymous, even though this is a long post what i read that jumped out was assault - have had support for this? the other thing i didn't read was to do with counsellng. has there ever been any support offered for this? you need to occasionally look after you, you can't help anyone else if you are not right. i wish you both some luck.

"  Hello all, I'm going to apologize from the start because I know this will be all sorts of messy and maybe confusing. I've been with my bf  for 5 years. Things were going relatively good until something horrible happened that caused us to move from where we lived into a new place but together. Despite the horrible circumstances, I was excited for us to live together. Little did I know all the stress and hard times that were going to come with this. My bf was still very sad and torn apart about what happened and although he had every right to feel that way, his negativity was starting to stress me out. I suddenly felt like I couldn't handle the situation we were in, I felt guilty because it was my idea to move and I didn't know how to take care of him or make him feel better. After a while I just felt trapped in a s****y situation. I'll make this part of the story short. I began a new job and in that job I started getting attracted to a coworker. Needless to say after a few months I ended up cheating on my bf with said coworker. At first I kept blaming my bf but I came to realize it was all my greediness. The craving of wanting something new, stress free, where things were fun and I got to feel desire again. Crushing on this coworker also made me feel like I'd have a backup if all went wrong with my bf so I was really feeding and going all into it. This coworker ended up finding a new job and with that the cheating ended. For a while I didn't feel bad but all of a sudden I started panicking. I felt disgusted with myself. I confessed to my bf and after many long discussions and talks here we are still together. We moved to a new place again and things here are going much better.  My bf has forgiven me but I can't seem to forgive myself. I know everything I did pretty much classifies me as a worthless b***h but I really do love my bf. I enjoy taking care of us, I feel so much comfort and peace when I lay in his arms. The problem is that now usually at night I can't stop overthinking.

  Anyone tried it? Did it help? ,  Thank you for the reply! I'm glad it was helpful for you. My neurologist recommended it but after reading some reviews online I'm skeptical. Just curious what other's experiences have been like. But good to know you had a good outcome from it!        ,None
  Anyone tried it? Did it help? ,"  Being skeptical is pretty normal I just went for it as I was desperate to reduce the depression I was continually experiencing. Speaking to the psychiatrist at the clinic in London ( I live in the UK) re-assured me as I could of spent countless hours reading reviews of people saying it worked or didn‚Äôt  work. I really didnt have anything to lose and was willing to give anything a go. I really didn't want to keep taking medication either because to me it was daily reminder that I was 'depressed' or needed ongoing treatment. With doing TMS i just wanted an intensive period of treatment then get on with my life and not identify as a depressed patient anymore, that was annoying me more than anything. Its hard to recommend a treatment, based on my own subjective experience but it appears that TMS has prevented me feeling the pain of a relapsing into a depressive episode since my sessions, and I do wish others who have been regularly depressed get that chance, and I hope TMS works in the same way for you.

Yesterday I found something interesting on youtube. I don't know if I'm allowed to share links, but perhaps if you're interested I can share it. Hmm, I don't really know. My problem is that I got these irrational fears and it's a quite large amount. Not being able to go outside is like a consequence of other problems. Especially the social phobia of course, but I don't know if just going outside is going to help that. Yesterday I went outside for a walk and I'm just constant worrying about having to communicate and having anxiety attacks. I don't really know if that belongs to agoraphobia. I often worry if something else is wrong with me, but my mom (where I still live) is sure that it's just anxiety, but on a level where I question everything. Like besides this social phobia I have irrational fears of feeling very uncomfortable by watching (scary) movies, panic of things like coffee and alcohol, but also even tea (lol). And besides all my anxiety I just don't know what I want in life anymore, because everything feels impossible.        ",I feel like no one understands me including myself.

"  hi, my boyfriend is suffering from PTSD and depression.

","  I am sorry to hear about your boyfriend and hope he finds the help he needs in order to get back to being himself, at which time he will finally be ready for a real relationship.  Right now he may want to be ready for a relationship but he is not emotionally healthy enough to have one yet. I hope that you find the courage and strength to withdraw from this situation and allow him the time he needs to get better, without the added complications of a partner to satisfy.

","  I do see your point.  If your son has grown attached to this man as a father figure, I understand the reluctance to leave.  I hope the boy isn't being mistreated in any way, including irritability or shortness of temper displayed towards him by your boyfriend. Your idea to do everything you can to support your partner is very noble but not a healthy choice for you because you are sacrificing too much - and by that I mean sacrificing the love and affection you deserve to have in your life.  And perhaps your son is also neglected in this way by your partner.   Women have to be careful how much they're willing to accept in a relationship because we tend to martyr ourselves and be too willing to be caregivers to a man.  And it's only later when we look back that we realize we made a mistake in staying. Your original post here seemed to be asking for help in taking care of this man;  but what I see here is that you need help in taking care of yourself and evaluating whether your son is receiving the love and care from this man that he deserves or if both of you are being neglected.

"  Hello all, This has been on my mind for quite a while now and I'm starting to wonder if I need to make the investment in seeking a psychiatric assessment.  I've been having issues with anxiety/ depression since I was about 16 but only sought help when I was 19. I'm now 23 and the last year has been bad after a relatively stable period (admittedly there has been a lot for me to deal with in the past 18 months- this isn't out of the blue) I'm increasingly struggling to cope and most days I feel incredibly down and suicidal.   Previously I've found my depressed episodes have lasted for 6 months max but at this rate I'm getting on for a solid 2 years of complete depression. My gp's never suggest being referred on. Had a group CBT course now on waiting list for induvidual CBT. Been having private counselling for the past 8 months but it's not working (most of it has been over the phone as I moved back to home town a while back). If anything I think talking about things that happened in the past have made me worse. Citalopram worked in the past and currently I'm weaning myself off sertraline (under doctors instructions) as it has made me 10 x worse. My private therapist and psychiatric nurse at my doctors say that I am not presenting any clear signs of bipolar (which is what is concerning me ) and its anxiety/depression. I cant decide if i should put the money towards further counselling with someone else or invest it in the psychiatrist. My family are increasingly concerned about me as I'm just not coming out of this latest depression. Thank you all ","  go to your doctor, get the right diagnosis, insist you get support in the correct area and then decide ONCE you have spoken to other people (like family/friends). you're young yet and you don't know what it is. good luck and don't be persuaded to do anything you don't want to.

During my marriage of 17 years I was very depressed wanted to self harm and got suicidal at times. I never took any medication in 20 years only for a short time.  In 2005 I was suicidal so I contacted mental health crisis team and then I was put on medication. Sadly it made me like a zombie I couldnt even cry and then In oct 2018 I attempted suicide after some very bad experiences. So all I can say is there is good and bad to medication. I stopped my anti depressants but am not sleeping well.

You seem to be a very caring and patient person who is clearly  trying to understand his depression though it can be very difficult as it manifests in so many different ways for different people.  Basically you're trying to rationalise with your boyfriend who is not thinking in a clear way, no matter how much he's convinced himself he is.There may be factors he's behaving this way towards you, fear, shame, self loathing, anger, avoidant  and or rejection issues etc which are causing him to become detached.It would be easy to say you do not need to put up with this behaviour towards you and it must be confusing to know where you stand.  The simplest way in which to deal with this is let him know you're listening to him and explain that if he doesn't want to talk, you will give him space, if he has blocked you,  don't try and follow up with phone convos, just let him know if he wants to talk you'll listen however, be firm with yourself that you won't be used as an emotional  offload when he feels this way. You say he won't take medication which can be dangerous. Can you speak with a family member that he may listen to?  People have varying degrees of depression and only a medical mental health professional will be able to assess the severity of him not taking the medication.You could offer to go with him just to support.  There is lots of help out there i.e.Breathing Space UK, Samaritans and therapists. Just don't go through this on your own and hope you too have others you can talk to about it, as all too often we forget about the partners, family and friends of sufferers. This is such a hard thing to say though there has to come a time if he continues to be this way toward you and you have tried mostly everything you can, is to leave and ensure he knows that if he needs any support you will be there as as friend. You too have your life to live and as heartbreaking as it may be, you will know you did everything you could. There are lots of people in here who have gone through similar and are only willing to listen and be there for you. Take care        ",then  he started to talk to me less and less. i asked him when could we talk again and he said  i hope that we don t talk soon  and he proceeded to block me on all social media. he also said he didn t know if he loves me and that he doesn t care what happens to our relationship.

"  I have possibly been depressed for five years now.  In the start, I never really anticipated anything serious coming out of it, but now I know I underestimated depression. It has slowly started creeping into my social, emotional and personal life. For much of the time, depression fortunately didn't seem to affect my academics in college, but now that also seems likely soon. I know many of you'll might not like this, but I'm not ready to take external help (for now). I'm just too embarrassed about it. Probably no one in my family knows about my depression. Neither my few friends. I'm still in college and not financially independent yet, so seeking help privately is also very difficult. I know it might be the best option for me to take help from someone, but please understand that it will be very difficult for me to privately seek therapy. Once I become independent after college, I will definitely try to seek private therapy. For now, I am in need of non-external solutions. My depression stems from various roots. One of them is my appearance. I feel I don't look good at all. I know that is not entirely my fault, but it is difficult to be socially confident when you actually look ugly. Also, I feel a person of my character won't last in this world for a long time. I feel I am too nice to others and will sometimes sacrifice my own well-being to help others. I rarely say no. Now, such a nature would make a person proud twenty years ago. But today I feel used and exploited and under-valued. I sometimes feel I don't get what I deserve. I am weak by heart and personal insults hurt me quite a lot. I am not at all good with friendship, I feel. I usually am too 'uncool' to hang out with friends. I just feel different than them and maybe prefer being on my own. As a result, I don't have a strong support system around me. I have had almost no female friends in my whole life, which is enough evidence to convince me that I will never have a girlfriend. Additionally, I have a few problems with my sexual health, specifically my penis. This just makes me very embarrassed to even have normal conversations with girls. I feel like I have fallen into the pit of depression a bit too deep now. I usually have terrible mood-swings because of depression. Suicidal thoughts do pop up sometimes, but I am confident I can resist them. I am fully against suicide, I can assure you that. I will not let depression choose death, but depression is also not letting me choose life. I know my life story might be a messed-up tale, but I do feel I have that little spark in me to help get my life up and running again. I have tried countless times to improve my life, each one of them failing. Depression got me addicted to masturbation, which I have tried to stop hundreds of times. Still I couldn't help myself even after five years. I feel broken. I feel like I've given up and I'm just hoping for a miracle to occur someday. I need some advice on how to get back on track and more importantly, keep myself motivated. Any kind of advice or experience will be appreciated. Thank you. 1 like, 1 reply        Report / Delete        1              ","  Since there are things preventing you from seeking professional help, there are still ways you can help yourself.   Meditate for instance, repeating a mantra very effective.  Make sure you are on your feet and moving about every single day rather than just sitting.  Learn to let go of negative thoughts and practice affirmations, such as ‚ÄúI am more than good enough‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI attract healthy people into my life‚Äù and so on.  Make up affirmations that are specific to your situation. I was ‚Äòtoo nice‚Äô at your age, trust me it wears off as time passes.  But never, ever, sacrifice your own well being for anything or anyone.  Learn to say no ! I have felt different all my life and have always preferred to be alone.  We may be a subspecies in society but we are quite as legitimate as the outgoing types and possibly superior.  We are introverts and proud of it ! SLAA (Sex and Love Addicts Annonymous) is for people with sexual health problems.  I was in it and it‚Äôs very effective and exists all over the world.

Are your feelings of not wanting to be with your partner authentic feelings that you should take heed of and be guided by.  Or are those negative feelings the result of your severe depression. Another question is:  will your partner turn out to be a chronic 'hurtful' person or was the one incident an isolated one. My guess is that, because you have also been suicidal, this impulse to end the relationship might also be suicidal ideation. I'm not sure that this is the time for you to be making any big decisions because you are very emotionally overwrought. Unfortunately that emotionally numb sensation is a side effect of antidepressants. Are you in therapy?  This is crucial for someone like yourself.

","  Ann, I'm so sorry to hear of your struggles.  I am a long term sufferer of GAD and see a psychiatrist for treatment. I really think what you're dealing with is tolerance and inter dose withdrawal from being on diazepam long term. In the support group for GAD I attend, I have met 2 people who are experiencing this. This needs a careful hand to help you - beyond a GP's scope. A psychiatrist would know how to help you with this, and your long term anxiety and depression.  Please ask your GP for a referral, and if they won't help then find another GP who will. There are other treatments available for you that are beyond what a GP has to offer - therapy, other medications and a proper taper schedule to get you off Diazepam safely. Most importantly - please DO NOT try to stop the Diazepam by yourself.

Many feel reluctant to get involved.  Many GP's just don't have great bedside manners with any of their patients.  It's probably hard to tell what the issue is with your GP but if you feel uncomfortably you should keep searching until you find a good fit.  Tell your therapist how you feel about the situation.  Your therapist should be able to help you resolve any of your uncomfortable feelings.  If you still don't feel comfortable after working through the issues, keep looking for the right therapist.

"  Hey,  I've been having a strange time emotionally recently. So the year has been an interesting one for me.Swapped my really stressful job for one I actually enjoy, made a bunch of new friends both where I work and socially. It is in a very male orientated field though and at times I find people's humor/ banter/ comments feel like pot shots and a bit of a grind interacting with some of them. I'm a pretty easy going person but I get the feeling some people just read that as an easy target to make themselves look good if they take the p**s, which I struggle to respond to as I tend to take stuff for ages and then go nuclear when I do eventually snap. Still got a divorce dragging on, that I just want done with now (I feel trapped to a certain extent), 2 years it's been going on and it's a total money grab by her (on money I don't actually have) so it has now become a bit of a stalemate. I want a new relationship as I'm pretty lonely, I try to get out there but never seem to meet anyone that's single.One of my younger friends seems to have women throwing themselves at him all the time, he does fall in to the *sshole category.  It makes me think what the hell is wrong with me. To be honest though, the ""type"" of women he gets for are only physically attractive and are not the kind of people I would connect with. So I guess there's just an element of jealousy on my part. My depression is a lot better than it was and I'm starting to get a bit of the self esteem back that I used to have before I was with my wife. The emotional breakdowns seem to be a lot less these days though they can pop up if I drink too much. I don't know, I just feel like an outsider at times, like I don't fit in with the general populous and I'm now starting to get accustomed to my own company. I miss having someone to talk to on an evening and being able to cuddle up to in bed.

All that comes with a new day is more disappointment, more pain and everything just seems to rest on my shoulders, kind of like Atlas the Titan who had to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders.

Even without talking about it, you are an inspiration to those going through the treatment right now.While you think your sexuality is something to be ashamed of, think about why youre ashamed. is it someone else's values creeping in, because there's nothing wrong with being bisexual or homosexual.

I think there's a reason you've survived.  There's more for you in this life, that you're not able to see at this point.   I believe that everything we go through is a 'phase' and that it passes eventually if we just have the patience to hang on.  Even if it feels like nothing will ever change, a belief that it can change helps so much and for all we know it's that tiny belief itself that slowly brings about the desired improvement in one's circumstances.

I believe you'd be a perfect candidate for therapy and medication which has helped me so much.        ",  so i know nobody really cares and barely anyone will read this  but i think it might possibly help to at least write all these thoughts down and relieve my brain and anxiety by just letting these thoughts be out in the world i am a    yo male and i hate my life. ever since chemotherapy treatment  i started losing my hair  i know this sounds trivial  but when you think about it every day for the last   years and how self conscious you are about it  it really does a number on you . i wont bore you with the details but i have survived both a liver transplant and cancer  lymphoma .
"  I don't have it as bad as the most depressed, but I know that I have been alone most of my life so far.Thank you so much for pulling this up, I really need anyone to hear me out, listen to my pain, because it's been too much... I just turned 16 years old. Most of this was when I was 15.I'm always hiding away from people because I was ashamed of my weight (used to be a BMI of 25.5), and felt like nobody would ever want to see me because of how I did not look attractive enough and was never good enough in anything I have done, even getting a 95% in Art and drawing. I've been having an eating disorder and posted about it since September of 2019 (you can see it under my profile's posts). I have just relapsed, but not as low as 200-300 calories a day anymore.I eat 500 calories a day, just relapsed today. To put into perspective, it's like eating one apple, one banana, and a croissant a day. I'm eating about 1/3 of what I'm supposed to eat, and if not, even less than 1/3.I freeze in room temperature, I can't process things well, and my hair falls out alarmingly. I have dark circles under my eyes all the time, and I'm always exhausted. I also force myself into exercising and get really lightheaded, I'm lucky I don't faint. I couldn't take that I gained 1.1 kgs in 11 days. I did not feel good enough or powerful enough. My current BMI is 20.6. My goal BMI is 19.5, or so is what I think it may be. Till now, I feel overweight though I am far from it, which makes me want to be isolated and away from the world, like nobody has done anything wrong to talk to me, see me, or put up with me.Everyone has friends, loved ones, why should I interfere? Who would ever want to talk to me unless they had something in me that they could take for granted? I never feel good enough. I think that nobody would ever deserve the burden of talking to me.So, I just crumple up in a ball in my room, my heart crippling and aching, getting desperate for somebody to listen, for a hug, for someone to help me heal and recover from my eating disorder.From being overweight to becoming close to the underweight side of BMI in 3 months and 15 days is insane and not okay. But I want to keep going. I want to keep away from people. Things feel numb. It feels like I have nothing to do or to even lose at this point. Wake up, starve, eat a bit so I don't die or make my family mad for not eating at the lunch table, go to bed and sleep 13 hours, act like I'm happy and a cheerful daughter, cry myself to sleep, hurt, repeat.

I wish i could give you a hug & tell you how well you are doing getting through each day. I'll just have to send you a ""virtual"" hug. You mention family but is there no one you can open up to at all? Perhaps a teacher or counsellor at school. Have you connected with anyone your own age online or through a support group? It makes such a difference when someone knows what we are going through because they have been through it too. I battle depression but i have no idea what it is like to fight an eating disorder. i do know that you need to love yourself and have compassion for yourself to help the healing process. Connecting with others isnt just about whats on the outside....whats on the inside probably matters more. Dont hate your body or second guess what others will think. Give yourself every chance & never give up hope. Come here for support whenever you need it & you will find you are not alone. Be kind to yourself & take care.

I'm just a person who had gone the same situations as you. Being alone, being ignore, being desperate for attention, being down, being depress, being bullied, tease and just named it. But, I want you to know, you're never alone. Someone is watching you from above. Happiness came from inside, our self. As I read through your post, I see my past. I overcome my own depression by fighting my self, learning to love myself and accept who i am. Eventually, I can learn to love others, even the haters. I do not let other's to manipulate my mind. Love your body, and your body will help you. There's always someone hug, hold, walk with you everyday. That person is God. Being positive helps you change your mindset. Tell yourself, you are the best and you can do it. Every morning and night, when something bring me down, I tell myself, I am stronger than before. I can do it. I can overcome it. I love myself, I'm going to do what is good for my body and not for other's. I am doing this for myself. My happiness, only can be found in me not from my friends, my family but me. Peers pressure are very high among teenagers, but believe me, it's not worth trying to impress others and kill yourself by torturing your body to be like somebody else. I love exercise, because I want my body to be healthy again. I love eating healthy food, because I love my body so much even though I'm chubby. As long as I know I'm in healthy body, I don't care what others thinking. I decide what I want for myself. Be happy. Now, I'm still fighting with myself but I'm more positive than before. I did not see psychiatrist or taking any meds. I just find my way out of my depression. You are a very precious person. Remember, you're a chosen one. That's why you're the winner among all the sperms. You're a champion. Be proud of yourself. Cheer up and be strong. There's so many people out there are shouting for help. And you can be their example for being a champions for yourself. If you have time, I really really recommend you to watch a movie called ""A wrinkle in time"" . Here's a big hug ü§ó from me.

Depression is a disease like any physical disease, and you in particular have good reason to be depressed. I am worried about you not being on disability.  It sounds like you are definitely a candidate for it.  Is there somewhere you can stay while looking into this option so that you don't have to worry about losing your job?  Parents?  Please do not worry about being 'a burden' to anyone at a time like this when you are so in need of help. Also I would definitely share the entire situation as you expressed it above with your employer.  It wouldnt be right to have to leave that job without having explained your situation to them.  Is there a 'human resources' department where you work?  They are there to deal with this sort of thing. Once you find a degree of stability about whether or not you will keep your job and where you can stay if you dont, I think it would be immensely helpful for you to be prescribed the proper antidepressants and anxiety medication and seek the help of a therapist. Maybe you're already living with your parents and I truly hope this is the case.

My dad passed away 5 years ago or so, with actually very similar back issues of not being able to walk around in his own house, passed away in his sleep in a recliner because he couldn't get in and out of bed just like I cannot at this point (which is kind of twisting the knife). My mom would probably be an option, however she is extremely strapped for cash at all times, and actually right now recovering from a hip replacement surgery for terrible back issues and really having a nightmarish time with recovery. One of my brothers I haven't talked to in years because he is just a gross abusive person, and my brother here is renting a basement room in a house, which he is almost in his own life crisis from just everything (work, his own physical pains, relationships) and he has been diagnosed as clinically depressed. I broke down sobbing the other night as I laid in my recliner in pain, and noticed a picture of my dad on the bookshelf, and wondered which morning would be the one I don't wake up in my chair üò¶ I have a fiancee that has been very caring and supportive through all my horrors of the last 3 years, but when I bring up being depressed, I'm not sure if she doesn't take me seriously or just has bad experiences with it and doesn't touch the subject but she just dismisses it. Being that I can't sleep in the same bed as her anymore, I feel like we are almost losing part of our bond from the pain that forces me out of the bed and away from her side, and that is like a punch into the Earth as well. We don't talk a whole lot while she is home, we just feel distant, like my physical issues are keeping us apart physically for the last 3 years and the foreseeable future. I've told her several times if she wants to bail on this relationship I would not hold it against her, I couldn't imagine dating someone constantly going to the ER / going through surgeries / driving them to appointments / not ever doing anything with them because they are physically unable to move / having family circles gossip we are anti social or hermits because I just literally cannot go stand around for a few hours like a normal human. I did have one flash point of suicide when I still had my colostomy bag about 6 months ago, and I remember the seal broke so I basically crapped all over my chest / stomach, and as I looked down at the huge scars from emergency surgery and feces dripping across my stomach I snapped. Walked immediately to the nightstand / popped clip in the 9mm / rounded chamber / breathed rapidly bracing for impact / considered correct angle to shoot skull not to survive / felt guilty that I would splatter my brains all over a rented house / considered which room was most considerate to blow my head off in / eventually calmed down once I was in the bathroom. I mean who avoids a suicide because they feel guilty about blowing their head off in a rented space? Cleaned myself up and my mom actually came over immediately to pick up both my handguns that I've responsibly owned for 10+ years at that point, and she gave them to a state trooper she knows but she had no idea what had just transpired, only that I needed them out of my reach immediately. I had not thought of suicide since then, I really do not want to kill myself, but I almost blacked out with rage in that moment of gazing down at my broken / butchered body covered in my own feces thinking ""Oh my god I need to get the hell out of this nightmare!!!"" Though I've never like plotted it or anything, it was like in that moment my body and my life was telling me f you, and I was going to tell it f you too for the last time. Life had gotten better after the colostomy reversal surgery was a success and I seem to have healed well from that, but now I just randomly go paralyzed / lose my job / life goes to hell out of nowhere again.

I also have chronic back pain every day of my life but stretches usually help.  Mine gets worse from sitting and lying down and those of us who have depression do a lot of that.  Is it for financial reasons that you do not have treatment for your back problem? It's so hard for those without depression to relate to us in any kind of understanding way.  They tend to think it's our fault and that we should just get our act together. It's taken me a lifetime to accept the way I am and to accept all the false steps I've taken to deal with the depression, like self medicating with Friday night alcohol binges when I was younger and the resultant wild activities associated with that. I truly hope you get the help you need here and can begin to accept the way you are and adjust your life accordingly to pamper and indulge yourself as much as possible to make up for the harshness of it all.

(I'm a 58 yo female) And because of that my husband has stopped our relationship. As for my back I've had numerous injections over the years, years of physical therapy, I was taking opiates for 10 years but I am not on them now. The back surgeon won't touch me because I have very brittle bones and have had 9 broken bones (6 in my back) in the last 11 months. My pain management doctor has agreed to put in a medicine pump that will deliver a continuous amount of morphine but his staff are moving so slowly.

What a great question.  There is a thing called chemistry as you know and it seems that you're just not feeling it.  You don't feel any physical chemistry but everything else seems very positive.  Whether or not it's the depression or the medication, I guess the ideal thing would be to bring this up with him in a way that doesnt hurt his feelings.  For instance, ""I really like you and am drawn to you but I don't feel the physical attraction that I wish was there"". Maybe he won't care and will want to pursue friendship with you without the sex factor.  I had a similar situation - everything was great but I felt zero physical attraction for the guy and in fact he repulsed me a bit in that way.  He ended up somewhat bitter even though when we went out I paid my own way out of consideration for his feelings, knowing that I wasn't physically attracted.  Looking back on this I wish I had summoned my courage and spoken to him about my lack of physical desire. Good luck and I hope you get to keep this person in your life on your terms, he sounds like a keeper.        ",I have gone on   dates with a seemingly nice man.

I am afraid to throw this potential relationship away, as I worry  this could be my last chance.Thank you for your help. 1 like, 7 replies        Report / Delete        1              ","  Ann, you sound  as if you dont really have an attraction for this man, so may be you shld be straight with him . it is not yr last chance of finding someone. may be sort yr mental health out first and then start searching for a relationship. i think whilst being depressed your not in the right frame. well i certainly wouldnt be.  its no fun for the other person to date a person that is depressed.  i actually drove my ex fella away.  its hard work being with someone  who is not well.  just my advice.

It also sounds like you are a definite candidate for antidepressant and anxiety medications. These issues you have about being separated from your wife during the day and whether or not you love her are legitimate emotional issues that can be dealt with in therapy but meanwhile the medication can help you curb some of the intensity of the crying, panic attacks and other over the top feelings.

Feeling unwell highlights everything I would imagine. Be easy on yourself, if you had a friend who was feeling guilty about feeling low, you would want them to kinder to themselves when feeling low. Otherwise it can keep you in a cycle. I remember times when I have been low, sometimes for a prolonged period. What kept me there was the constant rumination of the rut I was in, feeling worthless. Mostly its an over exaggeration after focusing to much inwardly negatively. i read Jodie's reply below, human contact is a start. Gets you out of your mind, talking does ease the distress, do you have a family member you could talk to? Or spend a couple of hours with? Also, when you are well, what do you like to do from time to time? What to you enjoy? Are there a few things that you immerse yourself in? Drawing, reading or something you do with others?

Taught me, as its easy enough for me to be back there, I've learnt a few things that work for me to catch it before it spirals.

So today, just being kind to myself and taking small steps, getting one thing done and congratulate myself - however funny that sounds.

I think you need someone to talk to, in your area can you self refer yourself.  Losing a Mum is very hard you have one Mum and its never the same again.  I self referred myself for counselling, the first counsellor didnt suit so if one doesnt seem right you can see another one until you feel comfy with that counsellor.  What you are feeling is normal and the apathy is depression.  Its hard meeting people I get that as it is very tiring putting on an act for people.  My Mam died three years ago and I have bad days, I do exercise to try to help but miss her very much.  Is there anyone you can talk to?

It would be helpful for you to accept this about yourself as well as accept all the results of your depressed state such as a messy house, etc. It also sounds like you may need a different antidepressant and if possible some therapy to talk things out for as long as you need to. Please don't dwell on what your mother's reaction would be to your condition and the condition of your life.  The important thing is for you to accept yourself as you are, and be kind to yourself and give yourself some slack until you can get this thing sorted out.

Also think back in time.  Was there anything you used to love doing?  If so perhaps forcing yourself to resume that activity at first would lead to eventual pleasure in it. When I was severely depressed and couldn't get out of bed, my brother came to visit and told me about goals -  set a goal for yourself and think of it as the light at the end of a dark tunnel and head towards that goal one little bit at a time.  For me the goal was to resume my role as an artist - a painter.  The technique my brother advised worked like a charm for me and it wasnt long before I was totally immersed in my painting once again after being away from it for a year or so.  And every day was awesome for me and full of the pleasure of my work. As I always say though, I'm no authority and I know that depression which you are clearly suffering from is a very delicate matter and I would hate to steer anyone wrong so treat what I say as my opinion and not necessarily something that would work for everyone.

"  I've felt I guess what you can call depressed since middle school. Never really thought about it and never really made a big deal about it to anyone. Just kept to myself and repressed everything that I didn't want to remember. This past year I enrolled in this supposedly great high school that has me living away from home and recently my roommate moved into a different dorm with someone else so I have my own room now. At the same time, I recently had multiple panic attacks and out of control thoughts that usually led to me wishing for death. Because of this I reached out to my parents and have started seeing one of the school's counselors every Monday to help. At first it felt good to come out to my parents about how unhappy I've been feeling with life and with all my repressed emotions, and then it all hit me. Every memory and every feeling that I had repressed up to this point is rushing over me like a tidal wave and it's overwhelming. I can't sleep, I can't focus on my work, I feel more unmotivated than I ever have before and I've been bawling non stop. I've seen my doctor in my home town but they gave some stupid excuse for why they couldn't put me on any anti-depressants and it's because I'm living away from home so they can't monitor me. I just want to feel happy. I'm overwhelmed with the stress from this school and from the feeling of unimportance and hopelessness constantly flooding over me and I just have so much rage and sadness built up in me I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to give up. I want to just give up on everything I'm doing and go home, go home and sleep for as long as I am possibly able to. Go back to ignoring everything around me and to forget everything from my past. I've never felt suicidal before but tonight the feeling is stronger than ever and it's scaring me. I want to throw away any hopes and dreams I had so that I don't have to think about the stress they're bringing me. I wish everything was numb but at the same time I want to for once feel something real. I'm just so tired of everything. I feel so alone. I don't know what to do anymore with my life. I'm scared of failing and becoming a nobody worth nothing but at the same time I'm tired of working my ass off.

There's such a lot going on for you here. Anyone would feel overwhelmed being away from home but you're also having an emotional watershed. This happened to my son and he experienced the panic attacks and the crying and the suicidal thoughts. Sometimes, things are just a bit of a wrong move and maybe this school isn't what you hoped. This happens throughout our lives and your well being has to come first. If you think its just trouble settling in, maybe you can ride it out but do keep talking to your counsellor and parents. Otherwise, it may be a fork in the road that you didn't see coming and you might need to go back home and receive the love and attention you need to process everything. My son changed schools when it happened to him and it was a rough few months but hes so much happier now. If you're totally miserable, admit it, you're so worth it and so precious - listen to what your body and soul is trying to tell you. I hope this helps you.

Of course it is overwhelming as you are not used to dealing with emotions. Now think how long you have been doing this so it will take time to sort out. It won't happen overnight. I think you need to take a break as you can't study effectively whilst dealing with all this. Is it possible to delay your education for a year and move back in with your parents? That way you can see a therapist, get some meds, and sort out your mental health. It doesn't mean you are weak or a failure as we all need help sometimes. It means you are strong to recognise that you have issues and are dealing with them. Would you feel the same way if it was a physical problem? Under no account go back to your previous ways as unless you start dealing with it will keep recurring throughout your life ruining your present and poisoning your future. x        ",I ve seen my doctor in my home town but they gave some stupid excuse for why they couldn t put me on any anti depressants and it s because I m living away from home so they can t monitor me.

I went through similar things back then and it didnt help that I was smoking marijuana.  But I had the full fledged panic attacks and was forcing myself to drink this horrible nauseating concoction of orange juice and brewers yeast to get a megadose of Vitamin B (for the nerves). I think that sharing your deeper self with your parents led to these even more intense experiences; but it sounds like stuff that just has to come out of you at this time. It seems downright irresponsible of your gp to refuse you the much needed antidepressants.  If he were competent he would have immediately referred you to a doctor where you were living who would take over your case and thereafter you could have two doctors who would share your file.  Please do all you can to replace this inferior gp asap.  The fact that he would turn his back on a patient who has suicidal thoughts is outrageous. You don't need to throw away your hopes and dreams forever, just put them on hold for awhile and deal with this emotional life experience you're having first. And please do not dwell on the reactions of other people - thinking you're weak, etc.  With the help of a therapist and the proper medication you can get through this stage and move out of it and onto the next phase of your life. Remember nothing is forever, all things pass, even the most intense things. Very best of luck to you and please waste no time in finding a new gp, the proper antidepressants and anxiety medication and a therapist who is a good fit for you and who you feel you can open up to and trust.  Do not get involved with any of those therapists who give you a cold stare and seem frozen and unfeeling.

"  I've felt I guess what you can call depressed since middle school. Never really thought about it and never really made a big deal about it to anyone. Just kept to myself and repressed everything that I didn't want to remember. This past year I enrolled in this supposedly great high school that has me living away from home and recently my roommate moved into a different dorm with someone else so I have my own room now. At the same time, I recently had multiple panic attacks and out of control thoughts that usually led to me wishing for death. Because of this I reached out to my parents and have started seeing one of the school's counselors every Monday to help. At first it felt good to come out to my parents about how unhappy I've been feeling with life and with all my repressed emotions, and then it all hit me. Every memory and every feeling that I had repressed up to this point is rushing over me like a tidal wave and it's overwhelming. I can't sleep, I can't focus on my work, I feel more unmotivated than I ever have before and I've been bawling non stop. I've seen my doctor in my home town but they gave some stupid excuse for why they couldn't put me on any anti-depressants and it's because I'm living away from home so they can't monitor me. I just want to feel happy. I'm overwhelmed with the stress from this school and from the feeling of unimportance and hopelessness constantly flooding over me and I just have so much rage and sadness built up in me I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to give up. I want to just give up on everything I'm doing and go home, go home and sleep for as long as I am possibly able to. Go back to ignoring everything around me and to forget everything from my past. I've never felt suicidal before but tonight the feeling is stronger than ever and it's scaring me.

Because of my psychological history, I avoided marriage because I did not want to have children inherit or develop anxiety and depression.

He just doesn't believe me.  He blames me for everything and makes me feel guilty. I try not to take things personally (since I know depressed people say hurtful things without truly meaning them). He becomes a completely different person. Recently, this fights have become more and more frequent and hurtful. He constantly ignores me (making me feel awful). I love him very much and I believe that I have been really patient but I'm starting to feel I'm losing my mind. I'm worried all the time, I feel lonely, sad, angry and frustrated. I even feel guilty for feeling all of this emotions when I know depression is a serious medical condition. I love him so much and I want to be with him forever. I just don't know how to cope with the depression while he constantly pushes me away. Last week he decided he will not be taking any more medication, which worries me very much because his medication had been showing positive effects on his behavior. I feel so alone and helpless.

Ok I get the pushing away bit but being selfish and treating you like c..p isn't part of the illness but maybe part of the reason he is depressed in the first place if you see what I mean. To give you an analogy if someone is an angry person for example and they get a dog, they remain an angry person but just with a dog and this just gives them more excuses to be angry, maybe at other dog walkers.  Do you understand what I am saying? x        ",Every week  we have the same discussion over and over  in which he accuses me of  not loving him  and  not doing enough for him .

"  Hi there. Im apologizing now for how long this is. I am a 19 year old female. Over the summer I was experiencing very bad anxiety and panic attacks and was not sure why. In August I had moved into my dorm room at a new college that I was going to attend. The first week was pretty good. The middle of the second week I began to get anxiety and then at the end of the second week I began had what I think was a mental breakdown or at least a really bad panic attack. I was having really dark depressive thoughts and horrible anxiety and was incapable of doing anything. I decided to go home that weekend and the rest of the weekend I still felt the same way. At the end of the weekend I decided that it was best for me to live at home and commute to school because I didn‚Äôt think living on campus was the right fit for me. I figured this was why I was so anxious over the summer. About a month went by and I still felt depressed and anxious. I then began to get these obsessive thoughts that I wasn‚Äôt in love with my boyfriend anymore and I was never happy with him. To give you a little bit of background I have been with my boyfriend for a little under two years. We have never had any serious problems and I‚Äôve always been really happy with him and he‚Äôs been my best friend and what I believe is my soulmate. We are perfect for each other. We were always so happy with each other and I was always excited to spend time with him and be with him. After this began happening my therapist and I thought it was best for me to go on an antidepressant and medication for my anxiety. For the last five weeks I have been taking 60 mg of duloxetine (Cymbalta) and 40 mg of lamotrigine (Lamictal). I‚Äôm not quite sure if this medication is right for me because I have been feeling emotionally numb. I haven‚Äôt felt any genuine good feelings like being happy or excited for anything, but I also haven‚Äôt felt really mad or annoyed about anything. I kinda just feel like I don‚Äôt really care about anything. Sometimes I can think about the past with my boyfriend and get sad and cry but lately I‚Äôve been feeling more and more numb. I know I should be feeling really upset and mad that I feel like I don‚Äôt love my boyfriend anymore, but most of the time I feel nothing. I just feel stuck and confused. I know I want to be with him but I am afraid of those in love feelings and excitement not coming back. He has been so supportive throughout all of this and I have been very open to him about my thoughts and feelings towards him and somehow it hasn‚Äôt made him run away. I feel guilty that I don‚Äôt get excited to see him and don‚Äôt feel happy with him like I used to. We both believe that even if we were to break up that we would end up back together because we think we‚Äôre meant to be together. I‚Äôm just afraid of my feelings not coming back for him. I‚Äôm not quite sure what I should do and wanted to come on here for some advice and see if anyone has experienced a similar situation. 1 like, 4 replies        Report / Delete        1              ","  Hi Shayes926, I havent been directly in your shoes but have been on the other party and very much do believe that depression can cause an altering of behaviour and feelings, particularly towards those you are close to. A bit of context. In my situation i had been with my girlfriend for 6.5 years. I knew from the beginning of our relationship she suffered with some mental health illness but she never really spoke of this and had never been to the doctors for a diagnosis so I stayed aware of them and the challenges they caused in the relationship but did not force her to address them. I tried to work through her issues as a couple and wanted to have a positive influence on her life which in many ways I have. I could tell she was head over heals for me. At times her love and need for attention and reassurance was suffocating and genuinely thought that if we ever broke up she would be a risk to herself. At times I found this too much and think I probably didnt give her the attention she wanted, but once again I saw this as a challenge we had to overcome as it wasnt a healthy way to live. She has started to get medical and theraputic help for her mental health after she was in a bad way towards the end of 2018. I thought this was a great step forward in her personal life and something that would benefit the relationship no end. So much to my surprise, after a fantastic start to 2019 which left me thinking about proposing, I found out she had been cheating on me. She partly blamed this on attention (me not paying her compliments, him paying her compliments) and also told me that she was unhappy in the relationship. After finding this out we tried to make things work for a while, and she would flit between having doubts about the relationship (and not being able to stop texting to other person) to talking about marriage and kids. Eventually she called things quits as she wanted to focus on herself. She never spoke to me about how she was feeling or told me that she thought the love was fading, to be honest she never really understood her emotions herself when she was upset. I really do think her mental health has played a big part in our breakup, either her placing ""blame"" for the cause of her deepening depression on me or being unable to understand herself falling in to a deeper love, or just having her feelings masked by the medication she is on. What makes me feel this is a factor is the speed at which she fell out of love (on our anniversary in May she sent me a card telling me that she couldnt imagine her life without me and loved me so much, and in July she had cheated) and the mixed messages she was giving me post me finding out.  The dates of when she claims she started doubting things also tie in with when she started falling in to a deeper depression. So whilst I dont have any proof it does cause this feeling, from my own experience I feel it is a real possiblity it can cause people to feel or not feel things without explanation. Hope this helps!

Yes, depression can leave you feeling numb; I call it ""nothingness.""If this is your 1st try at anti-depressants, they can take up to 6 weeks b4 you feel the effects.  Its possible the dosage of 60 mgs of Cymbalta may need to be raised; I do not know how high the dosage goes. Also, Cymbalta may not be for you.  It can take a lot of trial & error to find the right one.I have been  on a higher dosage of Prozac for maybe 2 weeks; I cant really tell if its helping.Ask your Dr. about the GeneSight test. You or the Dr. takes 2 swabs of the inside of each cheek. It is sent to a lab for results, that came quickly for me. The test can help guide medication selection based on your genetic profile. If your insurance doesnt cover it , the price is reasonable.I think you should hang on to your boyfriend, your feelings could be bc of the meds..

When I was your age I had the exact same experience of panic attacks which at the time I didnt understand at all.  At that time I did not yet know that I was suffering from depression and anxiety and could even be classified as ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù. I also reached a point where I could not get off the bed my condition was so dark and heavy upon me. Eventually I was put on an antidepressant and much, much later anxiety medication. The emotional numbness is a symptom a family member of mine had with her antidepressant. Please dont feel guilty about your lack of emotion towards your boyfriend.  Your former anxiety level called for medication and your lack of feelings resulted - not your fault. I guess you have a choice to break up with him but it doesn't sound advisable because of your honesty with each other and his sticking by your side through all of this.  However you ultimately need to be the one to decide to stay or go. Because of the effects of this medication, I would imagine if you leave your boyfriend behind you would not meet anyone new with whom you could sustain the initial excitement. You are one who really seems to need the medication and yet it has undesirable side effects on you emotionally.  Please discuss this with the doctor who prescribed it.

The only way I am aware this could happen is if you have forfeited your rights by committing a crime  and are locked up in jail or a mental hospital for years,  but is actioned by the State and not an individual. Also I don't agree that situational or reactive depression can't be helped with meds and/or counselling.  A few people are treatment resistant but this depends more on the individual and not the type of depression.

I cannot pretend to understand the depth of your suffering.  I have the deepest respect for you and what you‚Äôre going through humbles me. I am no authority by any means but I truly believe there are answers for every individual who suffers if they will just hang in there until the light begins to dawn. The therapist supplies support and absorbs your pain as you talk but they do not supply answers.  Those must come from inside ourselves.  This was bad news for me at first but later I came to understand how strengthening it is to know that we have our own answers and no one else can supply them. It sounds like you are experiencing a huge amount of frustration with your family.  If they're incapable of giving you the love you need, should you consider breaking away from them to some degree? Just trying out suggestions to see if anything resonates with you.

"  When I was in a support group each of us did a check in each week.  Maybe not with the same regularity but sporadically I want to do a check in with the participants here at this forum.

","  Hi Nancy, A wandering mind is part of the meditation when you use a mantra.  When you notice your mind is wandering you simply start repeating the mantra again. I experiment until I find a mantra sound that feels comfortable for me and it even changes while I'm sitting there doing it; but I hope to arrive at one sound that works all the time. The mantra can be one syllable or one alphabet letter even - whatever is the most comfortable and easiest sound for you to repeat to yourself. Just sit back or lie down and relax, take a couple deep breaths if you can and gently begin saying the mantra to yourself at whatever speed is comfortable from fast to slow and you can change the speed as often as you like and you can change the sound as often as you like. Then, when you notice your mind has been wandering, just gently resume the most recent mantra sound that you've been using. It does take experimenting in order to get comfortable with it so be patient with yourself. examples of mantra sounds  - - -   uh . . . ah . . . muh . . . mah  . . . puh . . . pah . . . sha . . . la . . . fah . . . or any old thing you want !!!   it can be two syllables also.  whatever works for you personally. ""om"" is the classic one if you want to try that. say it to yourself or say it out loud or do a little of both. as you can see there's a lot of possibilities and your mantra can be whatever one you come up with. Don't listen to those new age types who say it has to be a certain way  . . . they dont get it !        ",I m not looking at that as a bad thing however but rather as a  cleansing   or processing.

I wish I had some helpful suggestions . . . as the weather cools off and becomes brisk my appetite also increases and I'm also overweight.  I take 40 mg. Citalopram, 50 mg. Seroquel and I take anxiety medication as well.  The combination works well for me in terms of how I feel, but appetite is definitely an issue. I do know though that babysteps are easier to accomplish than big overhauls of your diet.   Just cut back a little bit here and there if you can and see if that gets you on your way towards losing weight.  Just do what you can do easily and don't expect yourself to do more than that.  Discipline should be gentle.

Like you, it took a lot of trial & error finding what may be the right one. My Prozac dosage was just increased to 40 mgs..If you have not had your thyroid checked, it would be a good idea. Thyroid diseases can create symptoms of depression. I just found out I have Hypothyroidism.  Also, there is now a test that simply requires 2 swabs inside your mouth, then thats sent to a lab. In approx 2 weeks, the results will reveal what medication has a better chance of working. Wish that test existed 25 yrs. ago.You must have hope. Like the rest of us, I go thru good times & bad.  Please do not feel afraid. Once you find the correct drug, you can be on your way to feeling better.  God's blessings to you.

I think only other depressed people can relate. Your sisters comment says she doesnt know depression is a chemical imbalance. First, it sounds like you need to return to your medication. If you are experiencing this terrible low after stopping your meds, that sounds like the problem. Did your Dr. take you off them or was it something you decided? Please know there are countless people who are going thru the same thing. I have gone thru that, too. You ARE NOT alone. Have your Dr. recommend a group of other depressive people who meet to share their common experiences. Or a therapist who specializes in talk therapy. It can help. Do not give up, there is hope & help. I am praying for you, friend.

Depression is a terrible and hidden illness that people who haven't suffered from cannot truly understand. All I would say is no matter how hard it is, please remember these feelings will pass. There is help available out there if you find close ones aren't very understanding. I too suffer from depression that I don't know the cause of and that can be frustrating but there are things we can do to help us cope as and when these feelings arise. I know it's almost impossible but please resist the urge to stop doing the things you enjoy. When we feel like this it's easy to believe that the best thing to do is stay in bed all day and not do things but from experience I would urge you to do whatever you can so you are active to some extent. Today I picked up my coat from the dry cleaners which I am pleased to have done. Perhaps going back onto antidepressants is an answer. Talking therapies may also be a solution which you can self refer yourself for sometimes. You WILL get through this I promise you.

I believe your depression is what is called 'situational' and by that I mean it is caused by one very specific thing.  It sounds like you've always suffered from a lack of confidence but the injury changed that into full blown depression. You also sound like you're going through a very tough and prolonged adjustment period getting used to the change in your appearance.  I am sorry about all of the consequences you've suffered as a result of that one tiny mistake on the ball court, which mistake you seem to be torturing yourself about.  Please remember that all adjustment periods eventually produce good results if you can just get through it.  Suicide is not the answer and I dont even believe it puts an end to the pain. It sounds like it's time for you to reach out as you've done here and then follow up with a good honest talk with a doctor who can prescribe you the medication you need to reduce your suffering.  I'm on very helpful medication to eliminate depression symptoms and in addition I have been in and out of therapy my entire lifetime when it was necessary to get through something.  The therapy was immensely helpful and I highly recommend it to you. Best of luck on your journey through this tough phase of your life;  just remember all things pass and you will make the adjustment if you just hang in there.

"  Hi everybody. I was reading some of the other posts on similar topic and it made me feel so much better about my own situation and helped me realise there was more of us dealing with similar story . Me and my partner were together for over 7 years and living together for over 6 , we hardly ever argued and he told me he loves all the time.We spent all the time together, messaging each other through out the day , going on lots of holidays together and socialising with out friends .Few days before everything happened he told me he loves me , 2 weeks before that he would like to get a dog together and we just booked our next holidays in few months time he also invited me to come to his home country in a month time.So I definitely wasn't expecting what was about to happen .I always knew he sometimes had problems with low mood and nothing seemed to cheer him up at times. He recently started drinking more than usual and stopped exercising all together . Few days before everything happened his grandmother died and I know he was very close to her which seemed to push him over the edge but he never shared that with me until it was too late. He started to sleep on the sofa( which was not uncommon as he liked to sleep with TV on) .I knew he was upset and he told me he should maybe see a specialist. I told him its a very good idea and I offered to help him find one. The next two day i was working full days but still messaging him the whole time to make sure he was  ok and sending him my love. It was 3 days after his grandmother passed away , while I was on my way from work when he texted me ""we need to talk"".i asked him what is it thinking it's something silly but he told me he is moving to his home country, that he is a mess, got panic attacks ,drinks all the time and he is not happy . He told me I'm amazing and I deserve so much better than him and he can't give me what I want. When I came home I was very upset as I felt like my heart just exploded into million pieces. He announced he will stay that night at our friends. I messaged him a bit after asking if he got there safe and asking him when he is planning on leaving.He told me he will be leaving in a month time and he will come and collect his things the next day. I asked if he is sure he definitely dont want to try to work things out and the answer I got ""it's not real love anymore for me and you deserve better"". After that I had nothing else to say the next day I came back home just to see our apartment completely empty of his things with a key posted through letter box, which wasn't easy thing to see.Later I found out from his friend he was crying when he was leaving . A day after I also found out he booked a flight home in 4 days rather than 3 weeks as he planned originally. He left his job within days and only managed to say bye to 3 of his friends, which sounded like a very rushed decision to me and everyone else.His friends told me later he wasn't great when they saw him and it felt like he didn't know what he really wanted. For them it was a big suprise as well as that's not something he ever mentioned to anyone before.I thought he will contact me before he leaves to have a proper conversation about what happened rather than text messages but he never. A day after he arrived he texted me to say he is sorry they way things ended and I am an amazing person and I deserve so much better than him. He said i should never blame myself as his head is messed up and I should be with someone who gives me everything I deserve.After that he wished me a great life and said he will never forget me. I messaged him back to say whatever he decides to do he should see a specialist as whatever he is dealing with won't just go away. He thanked me for caring and wished me good life again. I messaged him today just to wish him all the best and Im sorry its all ended and that I feel sad that I not only lost him but also my best friend.I told him at the end he is great person and he should never doubt that. I finished with ""I will never forget you"" .he replied "" I will always remember you have a great life"" So the way I see it if someone is telling me to have a great life 3x times thats means they don't want you to speak to them so I will leave him alone now and try to make peace somehowAny advice ? ","  Wow, I'm really sorry to hear about this hun. He must be really going through a really hard time and very depressed to just up and leave you like that. I feel so bad for you but on the other hand maybe it's for the best that you move on with your life and let him get the help he so desperately needs right now and you can move forward with your life regardless what he's doing. Unfortunately this happens more often than you think especially if he's struggling with mental health issues that are really serious and he's drinking a lot that would be a lot for you to deal with and it's not fun being in a relationship with someone like that especially the alcoholic part so maybe this is a blessing in disguise for you. He's right though you do deserve so much more than he could ever give you ( I would still go get a puppy üê∂ though for yourself) and I would not have anymore contact with him anymore until he gets his s**t together which sounds like it's going to take a while for him to get himself sorted out and don't let him start playing head games with you especially when he's drunk. Hang in there hun üíØ things will get better for you just take time for yourself now but make sure you take him off any bills that you two had together and stuff like that. Maybe think ü§î about moving to a new place of your own and starting a new life for yourself. I'm sorry he did this to you üòî, sometimes life throws us these big curve balls that we don't see coming and it's all about how we respond to them and deal with them that sets the tone for the future. Xoxo.

I messaged him a bit after asking if he got there safe and asking him when he is planning on leaving.He told me he will be leaving in a month time and he will come and collect his things the next day. I finished with  I will never forget you  .he replied   I will always remember you have a great life  So the way I see it if someone is telling me to have a great life  x times thats means they don t want you to speak to them so I will leave him alone now and try to make peace somehowAny advice ?

I dont like my surroundings or the type of people who live here.  They're very different than the type of people I grew up with and even though I've been in this area for years and years I never seem to stop feeling angry about the people here.  It is my own failure to prepare for my future and lay some groundwork which is responsible for me having to live in these conditions.  Dont get me wrong I am very fortunate in that my immediate apartment and buiding is in a pleasant area with trees and such.  It's as I said the people who get me down.

There are different forms of CBT  talking therapies which will be tailored to you. Practical CBT deals with the here and now behaviours, designed to help you through everyday situations and lasts for a few months.Other CBT therapies including  Schema therapy (normally taken when other CBT hasn't worked for the person), deals more with childhood trauma and is also face to face. It can take anywhere from 1yr onward depending on each individuals development. Contact your GP they should have these therapies available at no cost through NHS.There are lots of alternatives that you can do i.e. relaxation techniques, hobbies, trying hard to live in the now although they may help, they are not a substitute for therapy if you have severe depression and need to talk this through.

"  i have a step son 42 and he hates his life. He says he has no joy and if he was not such a chicken he would kill himself. His biological mother has already died. It was two weeks before anyone found her body. I never met her but I have heard many stories about how she handled her depression. This statement is not meant to sound judgmental. She drank so much that she developed sclerosis of the liver. She was a pharmacist that rarely worked because she started stealing narcotics.

To make matters worse, she looked for solitude in the Jehovah Whiteness, which facilitated the loner aspect because one can only mingle with people of the same faith.

It seems that no one provided any kind of opposition so she did what seemed to be the only thing she knew how to do. I see there could be a possible compound issue with her son.  We have a kid that could celebrate Christmas until he was seven then he was thrust into this religion that if you do not do certain things or mingle with people outside of your faith then you get a dis-fellowship(which has happened ) so any friends that he had made prior are strictly forbidden from talking to him so he has lost his God. I feel that depression may not be the only issue. He has been neglected and emotionally abused at the hands of his mother. I do not think this was done in malice, but a mother depressed that drink and took drugs while he was growing up could compound problem. I am reaching out to anyone that had any suggestions.

I think he watched him mom his whole life and saw that she dealt with depression in her own way. I never heard any one talking about counseling or psychiatry. She died alone and it is sad. I know he is not a kid anymore but his life time of isolation between the depression and his religion had left him seeing life through the only lens he has and has not really been around people that help him model behavior.  He is a super guy but he is so lost. When we die, I want to know he has the skills to maneuver through life. I imagine he has boundary issues given he has not developed his people skills. People tend to overstep and his limited experience with them has been less than desirable. I want to try to help and not do something that is detrimental to his recovery.

","  Hi Sheaton . . .  you are right, the mother was a hopeless case due to using her own self medicating methods instead of seeking professional help for her depression.  And the son was of course deeply scarred by that upbringing.  But I believe that the family of a grown man with depression can only make gentle suggestions and that‚Äôs about all.  It is not the job of the family to 'fix' this adult man.  And in fact efforts to do so can cause even more damage. Additionally, it seems to me that you are perhaps using this involvement with your stepson's problems in order to avoid facing and dealing with your own issues.  I say this as someone who has done that very thing in the past.  He is a grown man and needs to be looking after himself.  Having family continue to attempt to manage his illness is not going to help.

You would have to be a little closer to the situation to be able see the entire picture. You are correct about the part that I have issues of my own. I was nearly killed during a random attack and I am presently going to a doctor for PTSD and I could not be where I am today if I was not actively working a plan. It is through this ordeal that I could begin to feel what it might be like to have depression because the first six weeks I felt this darkness that I almost could not crawl out of and that is why I have reached out to this forum because therapy has helped me so much but I do not have depression and never belonged to such a restrictive group that nullified any relationship I had ever made. I think that coupled with his realization that he is utterly alone.  I did not think telling him to grow up would be effective because there may be some arrested development and underlying issues that may be at play. I would like him to feel empowered as opposed to victimized. I choose this forum because I wanted some comments from other people that have depression so that I know what to do. He never ask or calls to tell me that he is suffering, but I know because he only leaves his house to work and the store and then home again. He suffers in silence and it is sad to see anyone resign to just waiting to die. You have valid points and I want to thank you for your candor.

God, ........why this concept is so difficult is beyond me!3)finally, yes, it sounds like your stepson definitely needs some kind of intervention....and needs it SOON!PLEASE.....remember to breathe, and take care of you. you'll be no good for him unless you do so.I'm here for you (whatever good that is), so please feel free to email me.‚ù§‚ù§        ",To make matters worse  she looked for solitude in the Jehovah Whiteness  which facilitated the loner aspect because one can only mingle with people of the same faith.

His father is my husband and he tries to be there, but he is 72 and legally blind and has some health issues that we are still trying to figure out. I have been with his father for 20 years now and while I was watching some YouTube videos it mentioned that compounded depression is harder for individuals to seek treatment and that many times that the person  suffering will not even know that there is underlying issues that may interfere with treatment and at times the person may feel like nothing works and he will just give up and possibly start self medicating. I know he will not resort to those issues but it us sad to witness such a life. He has always lived that way so he does not see the loss. I am a cancer survivor so all I know is fight. If you knew him, you would see his character, he is a good man. He has assigned all issues that he is having to depression and he does not see that a lifetime of isolation could render any human being to curl up in a ball. I know that it seems odd that I am reaching out, but I tried to put myself in his shoes and consider how isolated he has been in his lifetime and it is plausible that he just does not know how odd his thought patterns seem even with depression. I think telling him to grow up just will allow him to feel like a victim and I am trying to find a way to help him feel empowered. thank you for your suggestions and comments.

Maybe a hobby, something you like to do, will keep you occupied and thinking of something else. Don't give up, many people with Aspergers lead normal lives, sure their are bumps in the road but God is with us every step of the way.

","  Hi MRD and thank you for your honesty.  I used to feel like I wanted more than anything for my cancer to return so that i could be admitted to the hospital where I would be cared for and all my needs met without my having to do anything.  Now looking back this seems to me to be a sign of depression because depression makes you not want to do anything.  Needless to say the cancer did not return and now I'm happy about that because my life is simplified down to the point where I really dont have to do anything I dont want to do except for my daily exercise walks which are a necessity to helping me feel better all around.  Depression is a tricky thing and depressive people have to honor their condition and not put too much on themselves, trying to balance their life so that the stuff they have to do like work for a living is balanced out by a lot of fun and pampering.  I'm retired so I no longer have to work for a living but for a long time I was piling stuff onto myself and that was making my average day very pressured and unhappy.  I've since learned not to do that to myself so I enjoy my life now.

  I'm undergoing through sort of depression since four months I wanna come out of this please help me out ,"  These conditions like depression and 'bipolar illness' which is what I have been diagnosed with are very, very tricky.  Adapting to the situation involves a lot of self acceptance as well as a sincere desire to get better.  There are no easy answers even though at times I've thought I have it all figured out and am a changed person. The good news is that with time you can become more adjusted to your emotions and feelings and become more accepting of them as you work to better yourself.  I'm on medication, although not a lot of it because I'm 74 years old.  I was in therapy which is recommended but the only therapist I have available to me was not a good fit for me so I am attempting to go it alone.

You're not letting anyone down. Depression is an illness and does not define who you are. It is so hard going into work when you feel like this, I know what it's like as I am currently doing so. Is there anyone else at work you could discuss your options with? Someone in HR maybe? I know you feel lost right now but if possible I think you should try and eat more even if it's a small amount. Not eating will sap your energy even more so and won't help your state of mind. We must hold on to the hope that this will pass.

I feel tired of having to explain myself. Yeah I feel like I know that I should eat, but I just don't feel that I can. I don't feel hungry. Sometimes I manage to eat ok, but other times when I've eaten it has made me feel quite ill afterwards.

Ele ","  Ele, I don't recall if you are on anti-depressants? If so, you should talk to your Dr. about trying something else. Also, maybe a therapist or counselor  could help with talk therapy. I understand about not feeling like yourself and the fatigue. Years ago, I could not imagine making it to the next day. I had to take each day as it came. Do not think about the future, its not here yet. Do not dwell on the past, it's over.  Focus on you. If you've never been one to read the Bible, open it. There are many verses about discouragement, sadness, hopelessness and other similar worries. Go online & watch sermons on depression. I have done all of that. There is comfort in knowing He is fully aware of your situation. He is with you right now. Let Him carry you during this terribly confusing & frightening time. Stay away from sugar & caffeine; they do not help depression.  God be with you. You are in my prayers. Take care.

So then a mental health nurse phoned me back. She said she couldn't put me in touch with my local mental health team. That it was my doctor who had to refer me to them. I had told her I had an appointment for the doctor that afternoon, so she told me to tell them I'd spoken to 111 earlier that day and that they'd be able to bring that up from the records. When I went to the doctors I saw a different doctor to who I usually do. I told her about that but she just told me that 111 is just an advice line. She said it will be difficult but I need to push through to starting the new antidepressants, and told me to take 6 of the propanolol tablets a day. Instead of just the 2-3 that I was taking.

Missing holidays is not a stupid thing to be depressed about if it is something that means a lot to you. And of course you have every right to feel depressed about your life.  We all do.  But that can‚Äôt be the last word. It sounds like a bit of cognitive therapy might be useful to you in order to help you ‚Äòbeat this thing‚Äô.  Definitely sounds like some rethinking is called for and some guidance as to shaping your future, both immediate and distant. I was one of the people with depression who failed utterly to turn things around because I didnt know to seek help and I preferred to self medicate with alcohol.  Now I wish so badly that I had reached out, gotten therapy and proper medication and done something to turn my life around.  Had I done so I would not be on welfare today as I go through my senior years.

I suffered from depression/anxiety for years.  Depression and Anxiety tend to go hand in hand.  The weird feeling that I used to get felt as if the blood was rushing into my head. Out of nowhere, it literally felt as if my pressure was soaring and I was going to have a stroke.  I went to many doctors and they found nothing wrong with me.  It was then that my therapist mentioned that it was probably due to my emotions and not anything physical.  Once I was no longer afraid, it subsided a little bit each day. I hope this helps you BJohn.  If you ever want to chat feel free to contact me.  I am here if needed.Take care and God Bless. PS-When I was first given zoloft, it made me very sleepy initially.

","  I am so sorry to hear of your suffering. ;y Spouse was given ECT against ehr will in 2015. Luckily I managed to stop them after 5 ECT sessions. She is getting better, and a year after her ECT she dumped all the psychiatric drugs, and is now Med free after 12 years of being on ""meds"" for her ""bipolar"" diagnose. She is going through a period of depression right now, but is coping quite well in contrast to when she was on the ""drugs"". A change in life is what usually kills the depression. Getting out, taking long walks, and enjoying nature. Usually it is the rat race of work/school, and a tight economy that causes the depressions.¬†After all it is only you that can change the tide. Only thing other people can do is help and support you. Psychiatry is completely miss lead, and tend to use ECT and drugs where they should be using therapy and other harmless treatments.¬†        ",I was lucky because I got support from a neuropsychologist who allowed me to understand and come to terms with my problems.

So this is an update  on my post last year.  So back then she looked 9 months pregnant, gained 10kg overnight, bloated up like a balloon & periods stopped + alopecia areata.  GP's were hopeless.  Just said metabolic syndrome and too  see a dietician.  Put her on pill.I took her to a naturopath & a gastroenterologist.  Gastro diagnosed clinical lactose intolerance & brilliant naturopath pushed for more testing.  My GP's didnt want to work alongside naturopath but because of the naturopath they discovered insulin resistance PCOS.  She was put on Metformin and low carb lactose free diet.  I found a new GP and an endocrinologist who both will work as a team with the naturopath.  We met the endo on Friday.  She examined 2 years of pathology & was shocked how much was ovrrlooked, such as high blood glucose.  From the blood work there are small indications to Lupus and Cushings & other not very  nice conditions.  So lots more pathology tests to rule these out.  My daughter has lost 8kg but its been a tough ride from when she finished her taper from the poison in Dec 2017.  She's not taking anti depressants or the pill anymore.  Only Metformin & supplements and her mood & hormones are doing well        ",  Hi there  I ve gained weight over the past   weeks after coming off of venlafaxine   I was on it on and off for   years.I thought it was due to the supplements I started taking   htp  l tyrosine  vit b complex  but I ve read a few reports of rapid weight gain after coming off meds.Has anyone else heard of this? ?Can the weight be lost?I m exercising and eating super healthy and gaining weight by the day......  help!!   like     replies        Report   Delete

"  I've been going through allot for a long time. At first the main issue was my daughter having behavioral problems at school. It was highly stressful but we overcome this and she grew out of it. 3 years ago was when everything started going really bad. So many bad things happened in a short space of time. One of my cats passed away and my aunt passed away December 2015. A week after that my mum had a fall and broke her ankle. This resulted in a blood clot travelling to her lung causing 2 heart attacks and a massive stroke in one night. She thankfully survived and came home July 2016. A few months later my beloved dog passed away and 2 weeks later my grandmother passed away.  A few weeks after that our last family cat passed away.  We didn't think we could take anymore hits, but only 10 months later my grandfather passed away of a broken heart. All huge blows and my family are all currently on antidepressants. I'm not though but i really think i may need to. I have depression and developed very bad anxiety. I've had some pretty bad anxiety attacks. My husband and daughter have always been wonderfully supportive. It's been very hard as my mum has lost use of her right side and we have to care for her. My dad works so my sister and i take it in turns going there and looking after her, cleaning, cooking etc. It takes its toll on me because i have allot further to drive. My sister lives around the corner and live about 15 miles away.  I've become a paranoid mess over the past year too, getting stupid things my head like my husband is seeing someone else when he isn't.  I've talked to him about it and he reassured me that he has not done any such thing. He encourages me to go to the doctor for some help. Things were ok for a while. We had a holiday in Greece which was lovely and my mood improved. That was until the beginning of October when my husband told me he was going away to Amsterdam for 3 nights for a work conference. I know this is ligit as i have seen the correspondence between him and his boss about it. I have huge fears of being alone and he knows this and found it hard to tell me about it. Yes i flipped out and broke down about it. My husband runs the department that this conference is about so it's important that he go because he needs to learn the new stuff that is being implemented. He, his boss and another young man from the team are going, along with some of the partners of this outside company. I did ask him not to go but he refused. I asked if we could go with him and he said no because no-ones wives or families were going and he was going to be super busy. Amsterdam has the closest  executive center which is actually the head office. I have expressed my concerns regarding certain areas of Amsterdam and he has promised and assured me numerous times that he wont visit any such area as he does not like sleaze at all. I believe him. My biggest issue here is being alone without him for a few days. I don't feel secure alone. I know it's not for long and I've gotten use to the idea a bit.

It‚Äôs very appropriate for someone in your situation; and for you to tough it out when you don‚Äôt need to would be a shame. Once you‚Äôre receiving the help you need from the medication, things like your husband going away on a business trip won't feel like such a crisis for you. It sounds like your husband does not like to make waves and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs leaving trip arrangements to the others, instead of asking for special consideration. You are definitely not messed up.  I remember times when I felt just as desperate as you do, and those times happened before I was put on medication.  It would be ideal if you could be diagnosed and prescribed for before your husband leaves or while he‚Äôs gone.  I just think this should be a priority in your life. Best of luck to you.

I am 55 and have been alone my entire adult life. I do not have children. Frequently, I am afraid. My clinical depression overwhelms me, as does my anxiety. I am so desperate for someone to talk with at night. To receive a comforting hug is what I would be grateful to have.You have suffered so many losses in such a short period. That is devastatingly hard to overcome. Please pray to our loving Lord Jesus Christ to carry you through this difficult time. I will also pray for your mental health & physical health.  Take care.        ",I know this is ligit as i have seen the correspondence between him and his boss about it. I have expressed my concerns regarding certain areas of Amsterdam and he has promised and assured me numerous times that he wont visit any such area as he does not like sleaze at all. I ve also looked it up and told him that there are flights coming back on the Tuesday night  he could be back early evening  but he said he isn t the one booking it so it s not down to him what time they go and come back.
"  I've been going through allot for a long time. At first the main issue was my daughter having behavioral problems at school. It was highly stressful but we overcome this and she grew out of it. 3 years ago was when everything started going really bad. So many bad things happened in a short space of time. One of my cats passed away and my aunt passed away December 2015. A week after that my mum had a fall and broke her ankle. This resulted in a blood clot travelling to her lung causing 2 heart attacks and a massive stroke in one night. She thankfully survived and came home July 2016. A few months later my beloved dog passed away and 2 weeks later my grandmother passed away.  A few weeks after that our last family cat passed away.  We didn't think we could take anymore hits, but only 10 months later my grandfather passed away of a broken heart. All huge blows and my family are all currently on antidepressants. I'm not though but i really think i may need to. I have depression and developed very bad anxiety. I've had some pretty bad anxiety attacks. My husband and daughter have always been wonderfully supportive. It's been very hard as my mum has lost use of her right side and we have to care for her. My dad works so my sister and i take it in turns going there and looking after her, cleaning, cooking etc. It takes its toll on me because i have allot further to drive. My sister lives around the corner and live about 15 miles away.  I've become a paranoid mess over the past year too, getting stupid things my head like my husband is seeing someone else when he isn't.  I've talked to him about it and he reassured me that he has not done any such thing. He encourages me to go to the doctor for some help. Things were ok for a while. We had a holiday in Greece which was lovely and my mood improved. That was until the beginning of October when my husband told me he was going away to Amsterdam for 3 nights for a work conference. I know this is ligit as i have seen the correspondence between him and his boss about it. I have huge fears of being alone and he knows this and found it hard to tell me about it. Yes i flipped out and broke down about it. My husband runs the department that this conference is about so it's important that he go because he needs to learn the new stuff that is being implemented. He, his boss and another young man from the team are going, along with some of the partners of this outside company. I did ask him not to go but he refused. I asked if we could go with him and he said no because no-ones wives or families were going and he was going to be super busy. Amsterdam has the closest  executive center which is actually the head office. I have expressed my concerns regarding certain areas of Amsterdam and he has promised and assured me numerous times that he wont visit any such area as he does not like sleaze at all. I believe him. My biggest issue here is being alone without him for a few days. I don't feel secure alone. I know it's not for long and I've gotten use to the idea a bit. I know I'm going to hate it when he's gone but i just have to suck it up for my daughter.  She will be with me. Flight's haven't been booked yet but i he thinks it will be an early morning flight on the Sunday. Not sure why it has to be so early.  I've also looked it up and told him that there are flights coming back on the Tuesday night (he could be back early evening) but he said he isn't the one booking it so it's not down to him what time they go and come back. I know the people booking would do it with their preference but my husband is not interested in expressing his preference because hes happy to go along with whatever they want. This bothers me.

I don't know what i would do without my family. I find it incredibly difficult to function without my husband and even though i know when he goes away in 3 weeks i will be fine. It's just thinking about it overwhelms me and brings on my anxiety. I think I have put off making a doctor appointment for so long due to conflicted opinions of others, but i think i need to listen to my own gut. It's been so hard trying to cope. I just cry pretty much every day. When my husband first told me that he was going away, i didn't sleep that night at all because my heart wouldn't stop racing, then i was physically sick the following morning. Yeah, i definitely need a doctors appointment.        ",I know it s not for long and I ve gotten use to the idea a bit.

Know those feelings will go away, but its most important you see a Dr..The difference it can make,  may result in your world  going  from a scary place to feelings of ease. I know you think you cannot cope, but you can do it.  You must! I truly believe in prayer. Look in your Bibles index for scripture about fear, anxiety, & other things like that.You know alcohol is a depressant. Please stay away from it. Have a cup of chamomile tea for its calming effects. I have a small bottle of Lavender essential oil. Lavender is also supposed to be calming. I will just sit & hold it beneath my nose & deeply inhale the wonderful scent.Please know you are not alone. There are so many of us wanting the best for you. Take care.        ",I know this is ligit as i have seen the correspondence between him and his boss about it.

"  I have been suffering with depression for the last two and a half months. I began to have these obsessive thoughts about not loving my boyfriend anymore about a month in my depression. Before this began we were in a really good place and I never doubted our relationship and pictured my future with him by my side. I began to take cymbalta for my depression and lamictal for my anxiety. My anxiety is completely gone, but mood wise i still do not feel like myself. I feel pretty much numb to everything except i can feel sad and cry sometimes. On top of that I feel as if I am not in love with my boyfriend anymore. I still like having him around, but it doesn't feel like it used to. I miss feeling excited and happy when he walks through the door. I want to be with him, but I don't know how to get back to that place. He's been so supportive through all of this and I can't picture my life without him. I wanted to know if it was possible for antidepressants to numb my feeling of love for my boyfriend and if there was anything I could do to get the spark back. Depression sucks. ",  I have been on antidepressants for a week now and they have numbed my emotions a bit but not my love for my husband.  This may not be the antidepressants doing this to you.

"  Hi guys, I'm a 20 yo male who struggles with anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety and depression a lot. My whole life is a stressful ride. Unfortunately I couldn't develop myself in a well balanced environment when I was young. Since I'm 17 my life collapsed like a house build of cards. I'm at the bottom and I feel like it can't be any worse. I'm now on a level I can't go to the grocery store and even talking to my own family and friends feels hard to impossible. I sleep bad and feel badly grounded with the world. I feel floaty all the time. I have very bad anxiety to lose control and become insane. Because I isolate myself so much I think it isn't strange. It's like a cave where I can't come out. I try to distract myself by doing games and watching tv, but I feel like all of this makes it worse. I can't be starring at screens the whole day. I try to hold myself to a strict simple schedule of stuff which I can do at home. Honestly it's all in periods. Sometimes I have a week or 2 where I feel motivated, but I don't see any improvements and I stop with it.. I can't stand myself and I often wonder what my potential is and if there is a way out of this mess. I lost my purpose and I don't know anymore who my true self is. The list of all the negative stuff I deal with is so long. Recently I'm waiting for day treatment. It's gonna be such a hard time, because even the smallest things doesn't work out. Especially transport to it feels like a big issue. Hopefully it's going to work out. It feels like the only option left so I have to do it, but how?

Riding on a train was very, very difficult and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say a word to him as I rode there by his side;  riding on a bus would have been impossible had he been called upon to do so.  He had deep periods of depression where he couldn‚Äôt get out of bed.  Back then the information about depression just wasn‚Äôt available and getting treated or medicated was unheard of.

I think that my anxiety is the main cause of my trouble. It started out by having hyperventilations and having a bad trip on weed. I already didn't felt good before I had a hard time leaving my house. I felt very insecure about my personality at that time already. I was learned to keep everything to myself etc. I felt out of place everywhere. But at that time I did go out and did all the stuff normal people also did, but also not the way you supposed to feel. I think everything is connected to each other. At least that's where I'm hoping for. Like if one symptom gets less the others go down as well. I think my character is all or nothing. Now it's nothing. Hopefully this will change one day. I just want to explore the world, but I can't for a long time now. I want to feel good in my own skin and be confident who I am. Maybe a girlfriend as well. But now I feel like I can't even take care of myself, standalone somebody else. It makes me depressed that I don't really have that opportunity. May I ask how it's going on with the person who had sort of the same problems as I have? I hope my English is ok, it's not my 1st language;)        ",I m now on a level I can t go to the grocery store and even talking to my own family and friends feels hard to impossible.

I also don't take medication because of this reason. I'm so sorry to hear about your ex-boyfriend. Hopefully he is in a better place now. Alcohol is a b***h, I can tell, because of people in my family who are alcoholic too. You know, it's not something I don't mis or anything, but I feel like I lack something. I think that's normal, because you know, that's nature. The reason you describe is one of the main reasons I don't want to have anyone right now.

Hopefully one day I can be a confident person who understands myself completely and be at peace with myself without a crazy amount of anxiety.

I certainly did it when I was younger.  And 'bad trips' and lingering symptoms are part of the situation.  Do not feel bad about doing these things in your past, it's understandable but I'm glad to hear that you've stopped and being afraid of 'stimulants' is wise.  I dont drink caffeinated coffee because it freaks me out.  And I dont go near pot or alcohol anymore now that I'm older.  These are the limitations we have to live with because of our depression. But you will definitely come to understand and accept yourself over time and your path will take you to solutions for the anxiety.  I take medication for that and it works very well.  We need to embrace whatever medical science has to offer in the way of help for depression, and a certain amount of experimentation with a doctor's guidance may be necessary in order to arrive at the right mix. I like my medications because they make me feel good and they make me relaxed and safe, when combined with certain mental habits I've learned, like letting go of worry and trusting God or life to handle your problems for you instead of racking your own brains to come up with solutions. Be patient with yourself and give yourself all the time you need to achieve a degree of stability.  Don't expect too much of yourself, that's part of accepting your depression and learning to live with it. There's so much more I could probably say to you because I see in you someone who is pretty much at the beginning of his journey to recovery.  And by recovery I do not mean being 'cured' as such but achieving the maximum possible for yourself. Let your goals be gentle ones - not too harsh - and no steep mountains to climb ! Happiness awaits you as you travel this path and learning to be gentle with yourself is crucial.

Before I had this I could enjoy a beer, but now even at 1 sip I feel stressed and that's just ridiculous. I've tried it a few times in these 3 years, but it didn't felt pleasant at all. With drugs I'm all done. I took Prozac before for a half year, but it didn't made a difference in a positive way. I've read a book about medication and honestly it has convinced me to not take a ssri anymore. Oxazepam might be an option though, but like I said, I've created anxiety for everything which does something with my mind. I don't know if I'm ready to overcome my anxiety on that part. Soon somebody comes to visit me who I didn't see for a long time and I feel stressed full it. I'm afraid to get panic attacks and I just overall feel bad. Do you have any tips to get in this without trying to worry so much.

Citalopram and 50 mg. Seroquel) and if I try to drink I get a freakish feeling. My understanding is that for people who have anxiety and nervousness style depression, SSRI‚Äôs are recommended because of their soothing effect. Self created anxiety can be helped by cognitive therapy. There are no easy answers or magic solutions.  Experimentation and working on your self are required to make any headway but you probably already know this. I was so disappointed when my first therapist refused to give me answers and solutions but she did me a great favor because she introduced me to the fact that I must rely on myself for these things.  Disappointing at first but quite fruitful in the long run. Tips:  You need to turn your mind off when you notice yourself worrying and stressing.  You need to turn away from that stuff.  You could start practicing that with this upcoming visit from an old acquaintance. Another thing that is vital to my peace of mind and getting rid of anxiety is to begin trusting in something loving and bigger than yourself - it could be god (as it is for me) or it could be life.  The point is to trust, trust, trust !  I worked on trusting for a long time.  Whatever I am worried or scared about I turn it over to this higher being and then force myself to stop thinking about it.  You have to work on believing that it will be taken care of for you and that you dont have to think about it at all. Also helpful are affirmations:  for instance say to yourself ‚Äúthis visit will go quite smoothly and quickly and be no problem at all for me‚Äù  . . . ‚ÄúI will probably end up enjoying this visit and be sorry when it‚Äôs over‚Äù. I see now that you are beginning to reach out for help and answers and I wish you blessings and best luck as you travel down your path towards becoming a better version of yourself.  This path although scary for you at the moment, was chosen especially for you because of the ultimate fruitfulness of it.

I agree that in the end it's you who's got to do it, but I think that the right help is changing a lot. I've tried your first tip, but it was really hard.

The conversation went mwah. At least it went better then all the possibilities I thought of before. I did experience a lot of anxiety, but luckily no panic attack. I've had to pinch myself constantly through which is a very bad habit though. Hopefully things are going to change positively from now on.

","  You sound lonely and it is hard when kids grow up and do not realise parents need love too. Almost unfair really. I empathize with that aspect of what you are saying. I wonder myself what to do as i age and hope maybe a retirement community or something. Everything is so costly. This new world ignores their elderly, or almost elderly community. They dont realise it, i bet if you lived in a place where there were other people in the same life stage it wouldnt feel so bleak. Death isnt the answer. It might seem like a answer or an out but who even knows about afterlifes. Praying it is wonderful and all that but not a place you get to choose to go on your own accord. Maybe give the doctor a call back or get a new one to speak with. Part might be depression but i feel like its lonliness. Not everyone is all outgoing and energetic to be all happy or self sufficent as they age. They should have some kind of groups or something for the ones between grown children and elderly because many feel the same as you. Sad in this world a pill is suppose to be the answer, pills do not cure loneliness. Pills can help depression though. Sending you a huge hug.                       ",I m so tired.

","  Have you had your thyroid checked? ¬†Hypothyroid can cause depression. ¬†TSH should be 1-2, if it's higher you could be hypothyroid. ¬†I'm speaking from experience. I think you are wrong about your daughter missing you. ¬†I had a friend commit suicide last April and it was devastating to me and many others. It came as a shock and I keep thinking there was something I should've said to ease her pain. I felt like you at one time and was in so much pain that I just didn't want to be here, but now I wonder how I got that down. ¬†I tried a low dose of Prozac (5 mg) and it helped get me other the hump. You should go see your doctor again and ask for something. ¬†I'm surprised that he/she didn't give it to you. They push it here (in the US). ¬†Maybe, as you say you don't appear depressed. ¬†You could put it in writing to make them understand. All the best.
